Crafty sellers have found a way to exploit this by using Facebook groups to mobilize fake positive product reviews.</p><p> Amazon doesn’t like this one bit and have taken legal steps to stop it. Here are the details…</p><h2 id="Amazon-Sues-Facebook-Group-Admins"><a href="#Amazon-Sues-Facebook-Group-Admins" class="headerlink" title="Amazon Sues Facebook Group Admins "></a>Amazon Sues Facebook Group Admins <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/court.jpg"                      alt="wooden gavel on table"                ></h2><p> Amazon has sued the administrators of more than 10,000 Facebook groups for allegedly using their groups to mobilize people to write fake or misleading product reviews in exchange for cash or free products.</p><p> According to an <a class="link"   href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amazon-targets-fake-review-fraudsters-social-media" >Amazon press release <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> :</p><blockquote><p>These groups are set up to recruit individuals willing to post incentivized and misleading reviews on Amazon’s stores in the US, the UK, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and Japan.</p></blockquote><p> According to the company, the fake reviews affect hundreds of products across the site.</p><p> One of the groups targeted by the lawsuit filed in Seattle’s King County Superior Court is the Amazon Product Review group, which had more than 43,000 members before Meta deleted it in early 2022.</p><h2 id="Why-Amazon-Filed-the-Case"><a href="#Why-Amazon-Filed-the-Case" class="headerlink" title="Why Amazon Filed the Case "></a>Why Amazon Filed the Case <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/case.jpg"                      alt="man writing on white paper"                ></h2><p> Although Amazon has deployed 12,000 employees and an AI-driven algorithm to detect fraudsters on its site, it doesn’t find them all.</p><p> Furthermore, Amazon says Facebook groups like the now closed Amazon Product Review group avoid Facebook detection by “obfuscating letters from problematic phrases” (misspelling or replacing letters of key phrases).</p><p> Therefore, Amazon intends to use the information that this case uncovers to “identify bad actors and remove fake reviews” that both Facebook and Amazon have failed to catch.</p><p> The issue of fake reviews is also being investigated in the UK, according to a <a class="link"   href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-to-investigate-amazon-and-google-over-fake-reviews" >statement by the UK Competition and Markets Authority <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .

Amazon has also reported more than 10,000 fake review groups to Meta since 2020. Meta has taken down more than half.</p><p> There are several <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/fake-reviews-amazon/" >tools to help detect fake reviews <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .

However, fake reviews can be lowered to tolerable levels.</p><p> Amazon, Facebook, and all tech companies have no choice but to fight the problem with all the tools at their disposal, and in cooperation with one another, in order for e-commerce to thrive.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/ensuring-security-while-utilizing-connected-websites-and-apps-in-fb/"><u>Ensuring Security While Utilizing Connected Websites & Apps in FB</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/is-facebook-in-charge-myth-busting-the-metaverse/"><u>Is Facebook In Charge?

Turning on the feature will let users communicate securely, whether over calls or text messages.</p><h2 id="Facebook-Brings-End-to-End-Encryption-to-More-Services"><a href="#Facebook-Brings-End-to-End-Encryption-to-More-Services" class="headerlink" title="Facebook Brings End-to-End Encryption to More Services"></a>Facebook Brings End-to-End Encryption to More Services</h2><p> A post on <a class="link"   href="https://messengernews.fb.com/2021/08/13/messenger-updates-end-to-end-encrypted-chats-with-new-features/" >Messenger News <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> revealed that Facebook is amping up security on both Messenger and Instagram.<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/enjoy-secret-facebook-messenger-conversations/" >Facebook started offering encrypted messaging on Messenger in 2016 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and now that same protection is offered for voice and video calls.</p><p> Facebook noted that having end-to-end encryption “means that nobody else, including Facebook, can see or listen to what’s sent or said.” End-to-end encryption is put in place to prevent bad actors from listening in on phone calls and messages—it keeps the conversation between you and whoever you’re talking to.</p><p> The platform also announced that it’s testing end-to-end encrypted group chats and calls in Messenger. It’s even expanding the initiative to Instagram, where it’s testing end-to-end encryption for DMs. Facebook said that the test will be “limited,” and will only pertain to one-on-one conversations on the platform.</p><p> However, Instagram users will have to opt-in to end-to-end encryption, much like you have to do on Messenger. This has become a source of controversy, as some Messenger users think their conversations are protected, but fail to turn on the end-to-end encryption setting.</p><p> Unfortunately, this update doesn’t turn on end-to-end encryption by default on Messenger—you’ll still have to toggle the setting on for calls and texts.<a class="link"   href="https://www.messenger.com/privacy" >Messenger’s privacy page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> states that the app “will become end-to-end encrypted by default,” but it doesn’t look like that’s about to happen anytime soon.</p><p> Related:<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/facebook-messenger-end-to-end-encryption/" >When Is Facebook Messenger Going to Offer End-to-End Encryption? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Aside from expanding end-to-end encryption, Facebook also said that it’s giving users more control over their disappearing messages. Users in the chat can choose from a wider range of times when it comes to how long it takes for new messages to disappear. You’ll now be able to choose from anywhere between five seconds and 24 hours.</p><h2 id="Facebook-Adapts-to-Growing-Security-Awareness-Among-Users"><a href="#Facebook-Adapts-to-Growing-Security-Awareness-Among-Users" class="headerlink" title="Facebook Adapts to Growing Security Awareness Among Users"></a>Facebook Adapts to Growing Security Awareness Among Users</h2><p> Many messaging apps, such as Signal, WhatsApp, and Telegram already use end-to-end encryption. More users are prioritizing their security, and that means limiting the communication apps they use to those that offer end-to-end encryption.</p><p> And although WhatsApp uses end-to-end encryption by default, that doesn’t mean it’s free of controversy. The Facebook-owned app <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/whatsapp-forces-share-data-with-facebook/" >debuted a new privacy policy in January 2021 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which asks users to share their data with Facebook.</p><p> That said, Facebook doesn’t have the best reputation when it comes to security, and its expansion of end-to-end encryption doesn’t necessarily make its apps more appealing security-wise.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/social-networking-mastery-for-your-career-journey/"><u>Social Networking Mastery for Your Career Journey</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/illusion-of-empowerment-interfaces-and-your-choices/"><u>Illusion of Empowerment: Interfaces and Your Choices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/how-to-publicize-positions-online-facebook/"><u>How to Publicize Positions Online - Facebook</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/the-new-era-for-facebook-employees-metamates/"><u>The New Era for Facebook Employees - Metamates</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/social-networking-platforms-adapt-to-sponsored-feature-trends/"><u>Social Networking Platforms Adapt to Sponsored Feature Trends</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/stepwise-alteration-of-childs-information-in-facebook-messenger/"><u>Stepwise Alteration of Child's Information in Facebook Messenger</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/facebook-video-annoyance-solutions-to-get-them-playing/"><u>Facebook Video Annoyance: Solutions to Get Them Playing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/how-to-disconnect-your-instagram-account-from-facebook/"><u>How to Disconnect Your Instagram Account From Facebook</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/navigating-the-winds-of-change-upcoming-us-antitrust-reforms-on-tech/"><u>Navigating the Winds of Change: Upcoming U.S. Antitrust Reforms on Tech</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/trapped-in-online-purgatory-discover-why/"><u>Trapped in Online Purgatory?

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Livestream-Instagram-No-Media-Necessary"><a href="#Livestream-Instagram-No-Media-Necessary" class="headerlink" title="Livestream Instagram: No Media Necessary"></a>Livestream Instagram: No Media Necessary</h2><p> Instagram owner Facebook is clearly feeling threatened by Clubhouse, because you can now disable both your video and audio feeds when you broadcast on Instagram Live.</p><h2 id="Instagram-Introduces-Camera-and-Mic-Disabling-Option"><a href="#Instagram-Introduces-Camera-and-Mic-Disabling-Option" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Introduces Camera and Mic Disabling Option"></a>Instagram Introduces Camera and Mic Disabling Option</h2><p> For those of you who use Instagram Live, it may please you to know that you no longer have to run video or audio feeds in order to broadcast. So, if you want, you’re able to broadcast a blank screen now, or just show your video feed if you don’t want environmental sounds bleeding into your stream.</p><p> Instagram has yet to announce the extra features officially beyond a tweet, but <a class="link"   href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/29/instagram-live-takes-on-clubhouse-with-options-to-mute-and-turn-off-the-video/" >TechCrunch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> broke the news, explaining the features in more detail.</p><h2 id="Why-Would-You-Disable-Your-Camera-and-Mic-on-Instagram-Live"><a href="#Why-Would-You-Disable-Your-Camera-and-Mic-on-Instagram-Live" class="headerlink" title="Why Would You Disable Your Camera and Mic on Instagram Live?"></a>Why Would You Disable Your Camera and Mic on Instagram Live?</h2><p> There are countless reasons you might need to disable video and&#x2F;or audio feeds in Instagram Live.</p><p> Perhaps the location you are broadcasting from has suddenly become noisy thanks to an influx of people. Here, disabling audio would be a sensible option, as you don’t want your live feed to be disrupted by external, uncontrollable sound sources.</p><p> Related:<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/instagram-vs-instagram-lite-differences/" >Instagram vs. Instagram Lite: What Are the Differences? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Likewise, if you suddenly don’t want your video feed to be available, like if you accidentally spill your coffee all over yourself, a quick flick of the finger will disable video, allowing you to go and get cleaned up (but you can leave audio on so you can tell your audience what has happened).</p><p> Not only that, but this has implications for people who might be a bit shy about going on camera. If you can disable your video feed and it is just your voice, then perhaps this might encourage you to join an Instagram Live chat or broadcast something yourself.</p><p> Same goes if you hate your voice but think you look a million dollars. Just switch audio off and let everyone look at your amazing face instead. Bingo, Instagram Live done.</p><h2 id="Why-Has-Instagram-Added-These-New-Features"><a href="#Why-Has-Instagram-Added-These-New-Features" class="headerlink" title="Why Has Instagram Added These New Features?"></a>Why Has Instagram Added These New Features?</h2><p> Instagram has got these additional features because owner Facebook fears big bad Clubhouse stealing all of its accumulated ice cream. This is a feature Clubhouse rolled out ages ago, and it has been popular with the Clubhouse community. Instagram doesn’t want to lose subscribers because it lacks features.</p><p> So, really, it is just Facebook&#x2F;Instagram jumping on the bandwagon. Yes, these features are probably a good thing. However, it would seem (looking at the comments on Twitter) that Instagram users want a lot more from Insta than video and audio options… like a platform that works, for example.</p><p> People seem to have a lot to complain about regarding Instagram, so adding Clubhouse style features should be lower down the priority list, or Instagram could start losing out to Clubhouse, anyway.</p><h2 id="Do-You-Live-Broadcast-on-Instagram"><a href="#Do-You-Live-Broadcast-on-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="Do You Live Broadcast on Instagram?"></a>Do You Live Broadcast on Instagram?</h2><p> If so, what do you make of these extra features? Too little, too late? Is Facebook focusing on the wrong things with Instagram? It may be a powerful and popular social media tool, but if it doesn’t work properly, it will struggle to retain a user base.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/the-rise-of-branded-content-instagrams-and-facebooks-new-focus/"><u>The Rise of Branded Content: Instagram's & Facebook's New Focus</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/tenfold-techniques-for-transforming-text-spaces/"><u>Tenfold Techniques for Transforming Text Spaces</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/understanding-the-heartbeat-of-facebooks-infrastructure/"><u>Understanding the Heartbeat of Facebook's Infrastructure</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/fb-sets-new-agenda-5-million-to-engage-journalists-in-direct-confrontation-with-substack/"><u>FB Sets New Agenda: $5 Million to Engage Journalists in Direct Confrontation with Substack</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/new-rules-for-discreet-facebook-and-instagram-interactions/"><u>New Rules for Discreet Facebook and Instagram Interactions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/assessing-online-anonymity-metacrypt-or-faceboss-for-quest/"><u>Assessing Online Anonymity: Metacrypt or Faceboss for Quest?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/beyond-gaming-the-true-scope-of-the-metaverse/"><u>Beyond Gaming: The True Scope of the Metaverse</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/second-lifes-chances-for-revival-in-the-metaverse-landscape/"><u>Second Life's Chances for Revival in The Metaverse Landscape</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-driven-video-production.techidaily.com/transform-your-videos-best-free-special-effects-apps-for-iphone-and-android-for-2024/"><u>Transform Your Videos Best Free Special Effects Apps for iPhone and Android for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/new-free-listening-transcription-tool-unveiled/"><u>[New] Free Listening Transcription Tool Unveiled</u></a></li><li><a href="https://meme-emoji.techidaily.com/new-how-to-make-a-funny-meme-on-macbook-for-2024/"><u>New How to Make a Funny Meme on MacBook for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/updated-from-silence-to-sound-your-essential-guide-to-audio-recording-in-windows-10/"><u>Updated From Silence to Sound Your Essential Guide to Audio Recording in Windows 10</u></a></li><li><a href="https://animation-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-5-photoshop-alternatives-to-animate-logo/"><u>Updated 2024 Approved 5 Photoshop Alternatives to Animate Logo</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-apps.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-how-to-resize-linkedin-video-thumbnails-for-maximum-impact/"><u>New In 2024, How to Resize LinkedIn Video Thumbnails for Maximum Impact</u></a></li><li><a href="https://apple-account.techidaily.com/in-2024-a-step-by-step-guide-to-finding-your-apple-id-on-your-iphone-6-plus-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, A Step-by-Step Guide to Finding Your Apple ID On Your iPhone 6 Plus</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-frp.techidaily.com/about-lava-storm-5g-frp-bypass-by-drfone-android/"><u>About Lava Storm 5G FRP Bypass</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/aking-money-on-youtube-a-guide/"><u>[New] Making Money on YouTube  A Guide</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="10-Things-You-Should-Never-Share-on-Social-Media"><a href="#10-Things-You-Should-Never-Share-on-Social-Media" class="headerlink" title="10 Things You Should Never Share on Social Media"></a>10 Things You Should Never Share on Social Media</h2><h3 id="Key-Takeaways"><a href="#Key-Takeaways" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways"></a>Key Takeaways</h3><ul><li>Don’t share your travel plans or photos while on a trip to avoid advertising that you’re away from home and potentially inviting theft.</li><li>Disable location data and delete photo metadata before posting to protect your physical address and sensitive information.</li><li>Avoid sharing personally-identifying information, such as your full date of birth or photos of important documents, to prevent identity theft and unauthorized access to your accounts.</li></ul><p> While a lot of people worry about what social media companies do with your data, the reality is that most of us give away more information than we realize. Let’s consider some important kinds of information you should never share on social media to protect your privacy and safety.</p><h2 id="1-Travel-Plans"><a href="#1-Travel-Plans" class="headerlink" title="1. Travel Plans "></a>1. Travel Plans <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Facebook-Leaving-Vacation.png"                      alt="Facebook Leaving for Vacation post"                ></h2><p> Think twice before bragging about your amazing upcoming vacation or posting pictures while on a trip. You never know who could see this information and use it for nefarious purposes. For example, if someone knows where you live and has malicious intent, knowing that you’ll be thousands of miles away for two weeks is an open invitation to rob your home.</p><p> As a safer alternative, don’t share any details or pictures about your trip until after you return. While this is less exciting, it protects you because you’re not advertising to the world that you’re away from home for an extended period.</p><p> This extends to posting photos of your home. Any photo of where you live gives people more puzzle pieces to help determine where you live, where the blind angles are around doors, windows with broken locks, etc.</p><h2 id="2-Location-Data"><a href="#2-Location-Data" class="headerlink" title="2. Location Data"></a>2. Location Data</h2><p> Social apps use geolocation (from your IP address or phone’s GPS function) to let you tag your posts with where you’re at. Before you post, check to see if the site adds your location data automatically and disable that before posting. Most of the time, there’s no reason to share your location with everyone who can see the post.</p><p> Depending on where you share photos, people may also be able to access photo metadata that shows more details about what took the photo and where it was captured.<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/delete-your-metadata-before-sharing-your-files/" >Deleting photo metadata before uploading <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is thus a wise idea.</p><p> This caution also extends to your physical address or phone numbers. You should never share your address or phone number in a public channel, as there’s no telling who could get hold of the information.</p><h2 id="3-Personally-Identifying-Information"><a href="#3-Personally-Identifying-Information" class="headerlink" title="3. Personally-Identifying Information"></a>3. Personally-Identifying Information</h2><p> Sites like Facebook are full of valuable data for people who use social engineering to steal your identity on social media. You should always avoid sharing information that can be used to verify your identity, such as your full date of birth. Never share photos of your driver’s license, passport, or credit card, which contain personal information that you don’t want to make public.</p><p> It’s also vital to keep an eye out for the “fun quizzes” that do the rounds on social media every so often. These ask you to answer questions such as where you went to school, what was the name of your first pet, etc.</p><p> These types of questions are often used as security questions to protect your online accounts. Thankfully, these weak security questions are being phased out on many sites, but they’re still a potential attack surface in many cases. Making these answers public could allow someone to break into your account;<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/protect-8-social-engineering-attacks/" >stay safe from social engineering <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by keeping this info private.</p><h2 id="4-Personal-Complaints-and-Rants"><a href="#4-Personal-Complaints-and-Rants" class="headerlink" title="4. Personal Complaints and Rants"></a>4. Personal Complaints and Rants</h2><p> Social media is not the place to air your grievances. If you want to complain about your boss, coworkers, or relatives, social media is a terrible place to do so. Someone will likely see it and let the person know, resulting in a messy situation.</p><p> It’s common for companies and governments to review your social media history when you apply for a job, clearance, or similar. Do yourself a favor and don’t make posts that make you look like a terrible person.</p><p> As a healthier alternative, why not start a private journal where you can rant all you want? However you choose to do it, keeping your anger off the public square of social media is a smart idea.</p><p> Note that many companies offer customer service on social media, so this doesn’t apply to getting help with a legitimate complaint. You should still be courteous in these situations, though.</p><h2 id="5-Self-Incriminating-Evidence"><a href="#5-Self-Incriminating-Evidence" class="headerlink" title="5. Self-Incriminating Evidence"></a>5. Self-Incriminating Evidence</h2><p> While getting in trouble over a poorly-worded joke or incendiary comment you make on social media is bad enough, it’s something else entirely to break the law and leave the evidence on social media for all to see.</p><p> It’s unlikely that you’ll see any truly heinous crimes admitted to on Facebook or Twitter. However, you may very well come across incidents where people make light of driving drunk or taking selfies on the highway.</p><p> Some even share photos of their drug stashes, illegal firearms, or cash that they’ve stolen. This also applies to explicit photos of yourself—it’s a terrible idea to post those on any social platform.</p><p> Do everyone (including yourself) a favor by never posting anything like that on social media. The few likes you might get aren’t worth the damage to your reputation or even going to jail for committing a crime.</p><h2 id="6-Expensive-New-Purchases"><a href="#6-Expensive-New-Purchases" class="headerlink" title="6. Expensive New Purchases"></a>6. Expensive New Purchases</h2><p> Many people love to share pictures of their new “toys” on social media. Whether you just got a new phone, laptop, car, TV, piece of jewelry, or anything else, you shouldn’t make the purchase public on social media.</p><p> The most important reason is practical: telling the world that you have a shiny new toy could result in some people wanting to steal it or take advantage of you in some way. An extreme case would be announcing that you won the lottery. If people think you’re well-off because of what you can afford, they might look to use that to their advantage.</p><p> Another effect worth considering is that these posts highlight a major <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/negative-effects-social-media/" >negative effect of social networks <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> : only seeing the highlights of everyone else’s lives makes it easy to feel like yours isn’t as amazing.</p><h2 id="7-Personal-Advice"><a href="#7-Personal-Advice" class="headerlink" title="7. Personal Advice "></a>7. Personal Advice <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Facebook-Advice.png"                      alt="Facebook Advice post"                ></h2><p> We’ve all seen people ask for homesickness remedies or legal advice on social media. No matter how sure of yourself you might be, it’s in everyone’s best interest (including your own) that you don’t give medical or legal advice to people over social media. This is true even if you’re a doctor or lawyer.</p><p> The key point is that you simply don’t (and can’t) know all the facts. If someone is sick or in trouble, they should seek professional help. This also applies to advice on exercise, weight loss, diet, finance, relationships, and other sensitive topics. You’re not going to get the whole picture from a social post.</p><p> It’s best to stay quiet on all of this because if you give advice that ends up harming someone, they could potentially pursue legal action against you.</p><h2 id="8-Scammy-Giveaways-and-Contests"><a href="#8-Scammy-Giveaways-and-Contests" class="headerlink" title="8. Scammy Giveaways and Contests "></a>8. Scammy Giveaways and Contests <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/06-Bill-Gates-Foolish-Comments-616x500.png"                      alt="Bill Gates Fake Giveaway"                ></h2><p> Social networks are prime ways for companies to run giveaways and contests, mainly because it’s so easy to click “share” and not think twice about it. While there are plenty of legitimate giveaways on Facebook and the like, you should think carefully before sharing them all of the time.</p><p> If you constantly share giveaways, contests, and invites to Facebook games, you’re probably annoying your friends. Even more importantly, some of these so-called <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/dont-trust-giveaway-contests-social-media/" >social media contests are actually scams in disguise <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . You could unknowingly spread malware or trick people into giving away sensitive data.</p><p> To be on the safe side, you should be wary of all posts that heavily encourage sharing and ask for personal details.</p><h2 id="9-Privileged-Inside-Information"><a href="#9-Privileged-Inside-Information" class="headerlink" title="9. Privileged Inside Information"></a>9. Privileged Inside Information</h2><p> It’s an easy mistake to accidentally post private information on a public channel. However, you should be careful about exposing insider information on social media. If you’re aware of protected details at your job, don’t share those anywhere, especially online.</p><p> Talking about someone who’s going to be laid off next week, your company’s strategy for the new year, and other insider info could get you in big trouble. This also goes for your family; don’t post sensitive deals about your family goings-on that other people don’t need to be privy to. If it’s not your own news, don’t share it.</p><h2 id="10-Anything-You-Don’t-Want-to-Make-Public"><a href="#10-Anything-You-Don’t-Want-to-Make-Public" class="headerlink" title="10. Anything You Don’t Want to Make Public"></a>10. Anything You Don’t Want to Make Public</h2><p> This is a bit of a catch-all for anything not covered above. If there’s one rule that you should live by on social media, it’s this: never post anything that you wouldn’t want the whole world to see.</p><p> On the internet, once something has been published, it’s pretty much impossible to remove it completely. Even if you set your posts to “friends only,” there’s no way to know for sure who’s seen your posts and photos, saved them, or shared them with someone else. Someone could always send a screenshot to another person who can’t “officially” see the post, for instance.</p><p> So if you post something today and regret it two years down the road, you may be able to delete it from your account, but it can never be completely erased from the internet. A good rule of thumb is to never post or share anything that you wouldn’t want to put on the front page of a newspaper.</p><h2 id="What-You-Shouldn’t-Share-Online"><a href="#What-You-Shouldn’t-Share-Online" class="headerlink" title="What You Shouldn’t Share Online"></a>What You Shouldn’t Share Online</h2><p> While social media can be a fun way to share with friends you don’t see in person, sharing online has many downsides compared to talking in person. It’s easy to overshare, not realize the audience that could see your posts, or make other mistakes.</p><p> Sharing information online voluntarily lessens your privacy and can open you up to attacks on your security, too. It’s wise to be intentional about what you share.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/steps-not-to-overlook-when-quitting-social-sites/"><u>Steps Not To Overlook When Quitting Social Sites</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/january-review-the-status-of-trumps-page/"><u>January Review: The Status of Trump's Page</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/steps-to-becoming-an-online-mogul/"><u>Steps to Becoming an Online Mogul</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/mastering-your-online-image-on-facebook/"><u>Mastering Your Online Image on Facebook</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/professional-growth-strategies-incorporating-facebook/"><u>Professional Growth Strategies - Incorporating Facebook</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/unveiling-facebooks-updated-privacy-center-strategies/"><u>Unveiling Facebook’s Updated Privacy Center Strategies</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/reclaiming-control-spotting-and-fixing-fb-hacks/"><u>Reclaiming Control: Spotting and Fixing FB Hacks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/recommended-frame-rates-for-professional-slow-motion-videos/"><u>Recommended Frame Rates for Professional Slow-Motion Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-tools.techidaily.com/updated-soundcloud-to-mp3-conversion-made-easy-top-tips-for-2024/"><u>Updated Soundcloud to MP3 Conversion Made Easy Top Tips for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-the-fundamentals-crafting-your-podcasts-rss-feed/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  The Fundamentals  Crafting Your Podcast's RSS Feed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/a-closer-inspect-of-the-stunning-dell-p2715q-monitors-capabilities-for-2024/"><u>A Closer Inspect of the Stunning Dell P2715Q Monitor's Capabilities for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/new-20-gratis-plus-purchasable-luts-enhance-canon-cams-for-2024/"><u>[New] 20 Gratis + Purchasable LUTs  Enhance Canon Cams for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/the-quintessential-toptiktok-tweets-in-popularity/"><u>The Quintessential #TopTikTok Tweets in Popularity</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/effortless-estimation-of-digital-gains-for-2024/"><u>Effortless Estimation of Digital Gains for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-creation-software.techidaily.com/new-unlocking-camtasias-power-speed-up-slow-down-and-more/"><u>New Unlocking Camtasias Power Speed Up, Slow Down, and More</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-2-ways-to-monitor-samsung-galaxy-s23-fe-activity-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, 2 Ways to Monitor Samsung Galaxy S23 FE Activity | Dr.fone</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="The-Biggest-Tech-Updates-That-Have-Been-Underestimated-and-Forgotten"><a href="#The-Biggest-Tech-Updates-That-Have-Been-Underestimated-and-Forgotten" class="headerlink" title="The Biggest Tech Updates That Have Been Underestimated and Forgotten"></a>The Biggest Tech Updates That Have Been Underestimated and Forgotten</h2><p> 2022 is fast approaching, and although many of us would like to leave this year in the past, there are still several developments that have had a significant impact on technology. These trends, features, companies, and personalities made waves in the tech world.</p><p> So, before we close the year, let’s look at the four biggest news stories that will change the tech landscape in the years to come.</p><h2 id="GameStop-and-the-Birth-of-Meme-Stocks"><a href="#GameStop-and-the-Birth-of-Meme-Stocks" class="headerlink" title="GameStop and the Birth of Meme Stocks "></a>GameStop and the Birth of Meme Stocks <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/WallStreetBets.jpg"                      alt="Wall St Street Sign with Blonde cool guy drawing holding the bets word"                ></h2><p> Image Credit: u&#x2F;lucushoule&#x2F;<a class="link"   href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g5n0nz/made%5Fthis%5Fwsb%5Fkid%5Fgif%5Ffor%5Feveryone%5Fuse%5Fit%5Fas%5Fyou/" >Reddit <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Making big money in stock trading is usually the domain of hedge funds and professional stock traders. However, one week in January 2021 destroyed this notion when investors from the subreddit r&#x2F;wallstreetbets beat the professionals at their own game.</p><p> When several retail investors discovered hedge funds shorted 140% of GameStop stocks, betting that its stock price would fall further, r&#x2F;wallstreetbets subreddit members rallied around the stock, buying it en masse. This caused the stock price to jump by 300% in less than three days, catching the professionals unaware and causing them millions in losses while giving the retail investors massive gains.</p><p> This event started the meme stock movement, where social media now directly affects a company’s stock price. It shook giant trading institutions and hedge funds to the core, where they saw themselves beaten by amateurs on a social media page.</p><p> Related:<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-are-meme-stocks/" >What Are Meme Stocks? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Although attention has shifted to cryptocurrency and NFTS, this news story set the tone of what 2021 could be.</p><h2 id="The-2-9-Million-Tweet"><a href="#The-2-9-Million-Tweet" class="headerlink" title="The $2.9 Million Tweet "></a>The $2.9 Million Tweet <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/twitter-jack-dorsey-nft-feature.jpg"                      alt="twitter jack dorsey nft feature"                ></h2><p> Although the first non-fungible token was created and traded in 2014, it wasn’t until 2021 that this term exploded in popularity. It started in February 2021, when several high-value, high-profile NFTs, including the Nyan Cat meme, were sold.</p><p> But the biggest name to join the NFT bandwagon came in March, when Twitter founder Jack Dorsey sold the first-ever Tweet for a cool $2.9 million. Since then, several other million-dollar NFTs have been sold, including a copy of the original source code for the internet.</p><p> Even established auction houses like Sotheby’s and Christie’s now auction NFTs, with the former hosting the auction in the Sotheby Metaverse.</p><p> Related:<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/jack-dorsey-sold-first-tweet/" >Jack Dorsey Sells the First-Ever Tweet <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Although NFTs remain a highly controversial topic, these developments have turned it from a fringe technology known only to tech geeks into something a bit more mainstream, with millions of users—from art collectors to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/nfts-gaming-revolution/" >professional gamers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="Welcome-to-the-Metaverse"><a href="#Welcome-to-the-Metaverse" class="headerlink" title="Welcome to the Metaverse "></a>Welcome to the Metaverse <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Dark-street-neon-lights.png"                      alt="Dark street lit by neon lights"                ></h2><p> In October 2021, Mark Zuckerberg announced that Facebook would rebrand its parent company to Meta. While this has no immediate impact on the day-to-day experience of using their social apps, it signs a shift in the company’s priorities from social media to the metaverse.</p><p> The company is looking at the metaverse as the next significant shift in tech, which changes the way humans interact with the internet. Instead of accessing the internet through disparate apps, services, and hardware, the metaverse links them together to meld a seamless experience almost similar to physical reality.</p><p> By changing the Facebook group’s name to Meta, Zuckerberg signifies to the world that they intend to become leaders in this technology, ensuring their users become fully immersed in their technology.</p><p> Related:<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-the-metaverse/" >What Is the Metaverse? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> While this is an exciting time for the metaverse, with even Mark Zuckerberg himself saying that he’s not sure what its future holds, we have to be wary of our privacy, as these systems typically run on our data—whether we want to share it or not.</p><h2 id="Apple-and-Facebook’s-Privacy-War"><a href="#Apple-and-Facebook’s-Privacy-War" class="headerlink" title="Apple and Facebook’s Privacy War "></a>Apple and Facebook’s Privacy War <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/facebook-app-iphone.jpg"                      alt="facebook app erased on iphone"                ></h2><p> When iOS 14.5 launched in April 2021, it allowed users to opt-out of tracking, thus preventing third-party apps from following you around the internet and selling your data to big tech companies. While this is a welcome feature for many Apple users, this was the first shot of the privacy war that Apple and Facebook are now fighting.</p><p> The iOS 15 update further exacerbated this conflict, allowing users to see which apps access which data and sensors, and when. You can even see whether these apps share your data with third-party entities.</p><p> Apple is an innovator in the smartphone space, with manufacturers following the company’s trends. So, if this privacy feature catches on and gets implemented in other devices and operating systems, this could dry up Facebook’s primary source of revenue.</p><p> Related:<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-the-ios-14-5-update-is-going-to-really-hurt-facebook/" >How iOS 14.5 Will Hurt Facebook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> That’s why the social media company will attempt to stop this precedent, as they count on user data to deliver customized advertising content. In fact, Meta made almost $85 billion from targeted online ads in 2020. Because when the data taps stop flowing, they can’t deliver target ads to their users, thus affecting ad revenue.</p><h2 id="What-Tech-News-Will-We-See-in-2022"><a href="#What-Tech-News-Will-We-See-in-2022" class="headerlink" title="What Tech News Will We See in 2022?"></a>What Tech News Will We See in 2022?</h2><p> These are some of the biggest tech news stories of 2021, and we’re looking forward to a more exciting 2022. While many of us won’t feel the immediate impact of these developments, they will shape how we use and interact with technology in the near future.</p><p> And as we march into the new year, we can look back at these developments and see the changes they will bring to our society.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/discovering-potential-partners-in-a-click-facebooks-innovations-for-singles/"><u>Discovering Potential Partners in a Click: Facebook’s Innovations for Singles</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/understanding-facebooks-identity-transformation-protocol/"><u>Understanding Facebook's Identity Transformation Protocol</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/pursuing-new-frontiers-fb-sets-aside-5m-for-groundbreaking-content-creator-tools/"><u>Pursuing New Frontiers: FB Sets Aside $5M for Groundbreaking Content Creator Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/discover-disconnection-a-guide-to-living-offline/"><u>Discover Disconnection: A Guide to Living Offline</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/the-explorers-blueprint-for-a-complete-analysis-of-every-facebook-interaction/"><u>The Explorer's Blueprint for a Complete Analysis of Every Facebook Interaction</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/exploring-phony-facebook-account-creation-schemes/"><u>Exploring Phony Facebook Account Creation Schemes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/balancing-convenience-vs-security-with-facebook-as-a-login-option/"><u>Balancing Convenience vs Security with Facebook as a Login Option</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/privacy-preservation-plan-dodge-these-3-invaders/"><u>Privacy Preservation Plan: Dodge These 3 Invaders</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/the-whistleblowers-guide-to-understanding-facebook-data/"><u>The Whistleblower's Guide to Understanding Facebook Data</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/remove-frp-lock-on-moto-g84-5g-by-drfone-android-unlock-remove-google-frp/"><u>Remove FRP Lock on Moto G84 5G</u></a></li><li><a href="https://bypass-frp.techidaily.com/in-2024-is-gsm-flasher-adb-legit-full-review-to-bypass-your-honor-magic-6-profrp-lock-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Is GSM Flasher ADB Legit?

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Social-Media-Preference-Poll-Here"><a href="#Social-Media-Preference-Poll-Here" class="headerlink" title="Social Media Preference Poll Here"></a>Social Media Preference Poll Here</h2><p> There are people who don’t use any social media, but the majority of us use multiple social platforms every day. Social media helps us stay connected with the people we know, as well as foster communities of those with similar interests. Every social media platform has its perks, but do you have a favorite?</p><h2 id="Instagram-Sharing-Pictures"><a href="#Instagram-Sharing-Pictures" class="headerlink" title="Instagram: Sharing Pictures"></a>Instagram: Sharing Pictures</h2><p> For sharing snapshots of your life, Instagram is the best social media app. There are other social media platforms that let you share photos, but none do it quite like Instagram.</p><p> Since the platform launched, new features beyond basic photo sharing have been added. Now, you can record video Reels and share daily snippets through Stories. But at its core,<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/reasons-why-instagram-best-social-media-app/" >Instagram is the best platform <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for people who want a picturesque scrapbook of their life.</p><h2 id="Twitter-Sharing-Thoughts"><a href="#Twitter-Sharing-Thoughts" class="headerlink" title="Twitter: Sharing Thoughts "></a>Twitter: Sharing Thoughts <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/3d-twitter-app-icon-design-1.jpg"                      alt="3D Twitter app icon design-1"                ></h2><p> Barring any changes that happen to Twitter under Elon Musk’s ownership, the platform is a great place to share your thoughts. You can share photos, links, and videos along with your thoughts, and employ <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/tools-writing-longer-tweets/" >different methods to create longer tweets <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you need more room to get your point across.</p><p> The current character limit for a single tweet is 280, which is perfect for summing up your thoughts in a few easily readable sentences. However, Twitter’s character limit may increase to 4,000 under Musk’s direction—at least <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-twitter-blue/" >for Twitter Blue subscribers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="TikTok-Short-Form-Videos"><a href="#TikTok-Short-Form-Videos" class="headerlink" title="TikTok: Short-Form Videos"></a>TikTok: Short-Form Videos</h2><p> TikTok lets you upload videos ranging in length from 15 seconds to 10 minutes, though most videos never reach the <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/10-minute-videos-tiktok-too-long/" >10-minute maximum that feels too long <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Despite that higher maximum length, TikTok brought back the energy of 6-second Vine videos many of us seemed to miss.</p><p> The platform is entirely dedicated to videos, and there are so many niche categories to explore, like BookTok or SportTok.</p><h2 id="Snapchat-Super-Social"><a href="#Snapchat-Super-Social" class="headerlink" title="Snapchat: Super Social "></a>Snapchat: Super Social <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/3d-snapchat-app-icon-design-1.jpg"                      alt="3D SnapChat app icon design-1"                ></h2><p> While you can have a public Snapchat profile, many people use this social media platform as a way to stay social with friends only. Sending a quick picture—either directly to a friend or to your story—is a great way to update people on what you’re doing without actually having to write out what you’re doing.</p><h2 id="Which-Social-Media-Platform-Is-Your-Favorite"><a href="#Which-Social-Media-Platform-Is-Your-Favorite" class="headerlink" title="Which Social Media Platform Is Your Favorite?"></a>Which Social Media Platform Is Your Favorite?</h2><p> Personally, Instagram is the platform I find myself mindlessly scrolling on every day, so I’m inclined to say it’s my favorite. That said, I usually browse Twitter and Snapchat every day, and hop on TikTok every other day—though often I’ll see TikTok videos on Instagram.</p><p> There are way too many social media platforms to list in detail here, so feel free to choose the “Other” option and let us know in the comments which platform is your favorite!

You Don’t Need a Facebook Account to Join"></a>1. You Don’t Need a Facebook Account to Join</h2><p> While you do need a Facebook account to create a Messenger Room, you don’t need one to join. For those who’ve <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/alternative-apps-quit-facebook/" >quit Facebook for good <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , perhaps due to concerns about the company’s privacy policies, it means they don’t have to miss out for one call.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/messenger-rooms-join-as-guest.jpg"                      alt="messenger rooms join as guest"                ></p><p> When your friends click the link to join, they can log in with their Facebook account if they wish.

It means that you can take your time, relax, and not have to worry about a ticking clock.</p><h2 id="3-Hold-Up-to-50-People-Per-Room"><a href="#3-Hold-Up-to-50-People-Per-Room" class="headerlink" title="3.

That’s fine if you’re just giving the link to a trusted group, but if you’re using the call for more public purposes, you might want to control who’s allowed in.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/messenger-rooms-permission.JPG"                      alt="messenger rooms permission"                ></p><p> You can do that easily with Messenger Rooms. From the<strong>Invite people</strong> window, click<strong>Edit</strong> beneath the room link. Switch the permission level to<strong>Only people you approve</strong> .</p><p> Then, when someone attempts to join, you can accept or reject. Bear in mind that if you enable this permission level, those joining will have to sign in to a Facebook or Messenger account. They can’t join as guests.</p><h2 id="6-Share-Your-Screen"><a href="#6-Share-Your-Screen" class="headerlink" title="6. Share Your Screen"></a>6. Share Your Screen</h2><p> Are you trying to describe something on your screen to others in the call? There’s no need. In Messenger Rooms, you can just share your screen with everyone so that they see exactly what you see.</p><p> To do this, click the<strong>Share your screen</strong> icon from the bottom toolbar. It appears as two overlaid squares. You can share a specific window or your entire screen.</p><p> Everyone on the call will immediately see your screen. Perfect for demonstrations, presentations, and more.</p><p> If you don’t want other people on the call to be able to share their screens, go to<strong>See call participants</strong> &gt;<strong>Settings</strong> &gt;<strong>Screen sharing</strong> .</p><h2 id="7-Host-a-Watch-Party"><a href="#7-Host-a-Watch-Party" class="headerlink" title="7. Host a Watch Party "></a>7. Host a Watch Party <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/messenger-rooms-watch-party.jpg"                      alt="messenger rooms watch party"                ></h2><p> If you can’t get together in person to watch a movie, your next best method is to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-host-virtual-watch-party/" >host a virtual watch party <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> With Messenger Rooms, you can watch Facebook videos together. Everyone watches the same thing and can control the video player, so everything stays in sync.</p><p> You can either chat over voice or via the chat box on the side. Give it a try—watch some comedy videos with friends or some sentimental memories with family.</p><h2 id="8-Chat-With-Text"><a href="#8-Chat-With-Text" class="headerlink" title="8. Chat With Text"></a>8. Chat With Text</h2><p> While you’ll likely primarily use Messenger Rooms for its video and audio chat functions, there’s also a text chat that you can pop out. Just click the<strong>speech bubble</strong> in the top-right.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/messenger-rooms-chat-box-stickers.jpg"                      alt="messenger rooms chat box stickers"                ></p><p> Here you can share files, GIFs, emojis, and create polls. It’s a nice way of making your call more interactive.</p><p> The downside is that only those who have logged in with a Facebook account can use the chat. That means anyone who joined your call as a guest will be left out—they won’t even be able to read it, let alone participate.</p><h2 id="9-Easily-Share-Your-Room-on-Facebook"><a href="#9-Easily-Share-Your-Room-on-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="9. Easily Share Your Room on Facebook"></a>9. Easily Share Your Room on Facebook</h2><p> If you do use Facebook, it’s easy to share your room to different sections of the social network site.</p><p> To do so, click the<strong>Broadcast Live</strong> icon in the top-right (it looks like a camera). Here, you can choose where to share your room to (timeline, page, or group) and who the audience is (like all your friends or specific friends).</p><p> You can also create a room from other Facebook apps and devices, like WhatsApp, Instagram, and Portal. If your guests use these, they can join from them too, no matter which you used to create the room.</p><h2 id="10-Kick-Any-Troublemakers"><a href="#10-Kick-Any-Troublemakers" class="headerlink" title="10. Kick Any Troublemakers"></a>10. Kick Any Troublemakers</h2><p> Though it hopefully won’t happen to you, sometimes people cause trouble in a call. With Messenger Rooms, you can quickly deal with these troublemakers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/messenger-rooms-remove-user.jpg"                      alt="messenger rooms remove user"                ></p><p> Click<strong>See call participants</strong> from the bottom menu (the icon looks like two people) and click<strong>Remove</strong> next to the offender, then<strong>Remove</strong> again to confirm it.</p><p> If your room isn’t already, it’ll be set so that only people you approve can join. Also, the person you removed won’t be able to rejoin the room. If they’re logged in to Facebook, you can ban them from ever joining one of your rooms again.</p><h2 id="Take-Advantage-of-Everything-Messenger-Rooms-Offers"><a href="#Take-Advantage-of-Everything-Messenger-Rooms-Offers" class="headerlink" title="Take Advantage of Everything Messenger Rooms Offers"></a>Take Advantage of Everything Messenger Rooms Offers</h2><p> Messenger Rooms is simple to get to grips with. Use our tips and tricks and you’ll soon discover everything that it has to offer. It might become your go-to tool of choice when hosting online gatherings.</p><p> Decided it’s not for you? That’s perfectly fine, since there are lots of other excellent alternatives like Whereby, Skype, GoToMeeting, Zoom, and more.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/three-fears-from-metas-social-empire/"><u>Three Fears From Meta’s Social Empire</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/digitally-elevating-your-social-media-profile-with-3d-photography/"><u>Digitally Elevating Your Social Media Profile with 3D Photography</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/facebook-innovates-with-subscription-links-apple-comparison-explained/"><u>Facebook Innovates With Subscription Links: Apple Comparison Explained</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/navigating-the-world-of-social-engagement-using-ripl/"><u>Navigating the World of Social Engagement Using Ripl</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/potential-game-changer-could-facebook-ditch-giphys-services/"><u>Potential Game Changer: Could Facebook Ditch Giphy's Services?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/decoding-the-future-facebooks-stance-on-metaverse/"><u>Decoding the Future: Facebook's Stance on Metaverse</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/top-picks-for-virtual-interactions/"><u>Top Picks for Virtual Interactions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/revisiting-relationships-insightful-look-at-facebook-history/"><u>Revisiting Relationships: Insightful Look at Facebook History</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/investigating-the-merits-and-demerits-of-social-logins-via-facebook-network/"><u>Investigating the Merits & Demerits of Social Logins via Facebook Network</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/stepwise-guide-to-sever-ties-in-fb-group/"><u>Stepwise Guide to Sever Ties in FB Group</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/the-mp3-essentials-guide-10-online-converters-reviewed/"><u>The MP3 Essentials Guide  #10 Online Converters Reviewed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-unlocking-the-process-for-final-deactivation-of-an-account-on-instagram/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Unlocking the Process for Final Deactivation of an Account on Instagram</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-cant-miss-these-buzzing-tiktok-trials/"><u>2024 Approved  Can't Miss These Buzzing TikTok Trials</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/2024-approved-grandview-media-mastering-the-art-of-selecting-a-cms/"><u>2024 Approved  Grandview Media  Mastering the Art of Selecting a CMS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-tweaking.techidaily.com/decoding-the-criteria-for-optimal-audio-post-production-professionals-for-2024/"><u>Decoding The Criteria for Optimal Audio Post-Production Professionals for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-part-of-the-touch-screen-not-working-on-itel-p55-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>How To Fix Part of the Touch Screen Not Working on Itel P55 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-effortless-access-download-tactics-for-live-social-feeds/"><u>[New] In 2024, Effortless Access  Download Tactics for Live Social Feeds</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-innovative-approaches-to-distinguish-in-the-tiktok-landscape-for-2024/"><u>[New] Innovative Approaches to Distinguish in the TikTok Landscape for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/how-to-change-netflix-location-to-get-more-country-version-on-apple-iphone-15-pro-max-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>How to Change Netflix Location to Get More Country Version On Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-professional-level-photo-enhancement-on-snapchat/"><u>2024 Approved  Professional-Level Photo Enhancement on Snapchat</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="No-Media-Livestream-IG-NOW"><a href="#No-Media-Livestream-IG-NOW" class="headerlink" title="No Media? Livestream IG NOW"></a>No Media? Livestream IG NOW</h2><p> Instagram owner Facebook is clearly feeling threatened by Clubhouse, because you can now disable both your video and audio feeds when you broadcast on Instagram Live.</p><h2 id="Instagram-Introduces-Camera-and-Mic-Disabling-Option"><a href="#Instagram-Introduces-Camera-and-Mic-Disabling-Option" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Introduces Camera and Mic Disabling Option"></a>Instagram Introduces Camera and Mic Disabling Option</h2><p> For those of you who use Instagram Live, it may please you to know that you no longer have to run video or audio feeds in order to broadcast. So, if you want, you’re able to broadcast a blank screen now, or just show your video feed if you don’t want environmental sounds bleeding into your stream.</p><p> Instagram has yet to announce the extra features officially beyond a tweet, but <a class="link"   href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/29/instagram-live-takes-on-clubhouse-with-options-to-mute-and-turn-off-the-video/" >TechCrunch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> broke the news, explaining the features in more detail.</p><h2 id="Why-Would-You-Disable-Your-Camera-and-Mic-on-Instagram-Live"><a href="#Why-Would-You-Disable-Your-Camera-and-Mic-on-Instagram-Live" class="headerlink" title="Why Would You Disable Your Camera and Mic on Instagram Live?"></a>Why Would You Disable Your Camera and Mic on Instagram Live?</h2><p> There are countless reasons you might need to disable video and&#x2F;or audio feeds in Instagram Live.</p><p> Perhaps the location you are broadcasting from has suddenly become noisy thanks to an influx of people. Here, disabling audio would be a sensible option, as you don’t want your live feed to be disrupted by external, uncontrollable sound sources.</p><p> Related:<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/instagram-vs-instagram-lite-differences/" >Instagram vs. Instagram Lite: What Are the Differences? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Likewise, if you suddenly don’t want your video feed to be available, like if you accidentally spill your coffee all over yourself, a quick flick of the finger will disable video, allowing you to go and get cleaned up (but you can leave audio on so you can tell your audience what has happened).</p><p> Not only that, but this has implications for people who might be a bit shy about going on camera. If you can disable your video feed and it is just your voice, then perhaps this might encourage you to join an Instagram Live chat or broadcast something yourself.</p><p> Same goes if you hate your voice but think you look a million dollars. Just switch audio off and let everyone look at your amazing face instead. Bingo, Instagram Live done.</p><h2 id="Why-Has-Instagram-Added-These-New-Features"><a href="#Why-Has-Instagram-Added-These-New-Features" class="headerlink" title="Why Has Instagram Added These New Features?"></a>Why Has Instagram Added These New Features?</h2><p> Instagram has got these additional features because owner Facebook fears big bad Clubhouse stealing all of its accumulated ice cream. This is a feature Clubhouse rolled out ages ago, and it has been popular with the Clubhouse community. Instagram doesn’t want to lose subscribers because it lacks features.</p><p> So, really, it is just Facebook&#x2F;Instagram jumping on the bandwagon. Yes, these features are probably a good thing. However, it would seem (looking at the comments on Twitter) that Instagram users want a lot more from Insta than video and audio options… like a platform that works, for example.</p><p> People seem to have a lot to complain about regarding Instagram, so adding Clubhouse style features should be lower down the priority list, or Instagram could start losing out to Clubhouse, anyway.</p><h2 id="Do-You-Live-Broadcast-on-Instagram"><a href="#Do-You-Live-Broadcast-on-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="Do You Live Broadcast on Instagram?"></a>Do You Live Broadcast on Instagram?</h2><p> If so, what do you make of these extra features? Too little, too late? Is Facebook focusing on the wrong things with Instagram? It may be a powerful and popular social media tool, but if it doesn’t work properly, it will struggle to retain a user base.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/mastering-untagging-from-facebook-pics/"><u>Mastering Untagging From Facebook Pics</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/unraveling-implicit-communication-on-fbc-platform/"><u>Unraveling Implicit Communication on FBC Platform</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/navigating-metas-identity-system/"><u>Navigating Meta's Identity System</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/meet-the-metaverse-discovering-facebooks-top-6-pioneering-features/"><u>Meet the Metaverse: Discovering Facebook’s Top 6 Pioneering Features</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/podcast-and-live-room-spotlight-on-facebooks-latest-hub/"><u>Podcast & Live Room Spotlight on Facebook's Latest Hub</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/regaining-fb-login-without-codes-a-step-by-step-guide/"><u>Regaining FB Login Without Codes: A Step-by-Step Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/facebook-starts-rolling-out-its-new-neighborhoods-feature/"><u>Facebook Starts Rolling Out Its New Neighborhoods Feature</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/no-more-likes-removing-someone-on-social-media/"><u>No More Likes: Removing Someone on Social Media</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/frugal-yet-effective-top-5-costless-methods-for-social-media-scheduling/"><u>Frugal Yet Effective: Top 5 Costless Methods for Social Media Scheduling</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/1719148986166-new-era-of-private-conversations-facebooks-encrypted-instagram-dms-messenger-calls-rollout/"><u>New Era of Private Conversations: Facebook's Encrypted Instagram DMs, Messenger Calls Rollout</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-apps.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-top-rated-free-video-editors-for-beginners-no-experience-needed/"><u>New In 2024, Top-Rated Free Video Editors for Beginners No Experience Needed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-twitters-viral-hit-list-tiktok-edition/"><u>[Updated] Twitter's Viral Hit List  TikTok Edition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-elevating-your-style-with-youtubes-best-hauls/"><u>[New] In 2024, Elevating Your Style with YouTube's Best Hauls</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-video-recordings.techidaily.com/embedding-youtube-playlists-with-minimal-complexity-and-maximum-impact/"><u>Embedding YouTube Playlists with Minimal Complexity and Maximum Impact</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-excellence-in-text-editing-with-ae-presets/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Excellence in Text Editing with AE Presets</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/2024-approved-crafting-visual-dynamics-illustrator-motion-blur-tips/"><u>2024 Approved  Crafting Visual Dynamics  Illustrator Motion Blur Tips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-auto-lock-greyed-out-on-iphone-8-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>How To Fix Auto Lock Greyed Out on iPhone 8 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/new-best-webcams-elevating-podcast-aesthetics/"><u>[New] Best Webcams Elevating Podcast Aesthetics</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-optimizing.techidaily.com/updated-crafting-captivating-audio-representations-syncopated-waveform-graphics-and-transformative-animation-in-adobe-premiere-pro-for-2024/"><u>Updated Crafting Captivating Audio Representations Syncopated Waveform Graphics and Transformative Animation in Adobe Premiere Pro for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/new-beyond-the-lens-the-complete-selfie-confirmation-on-ig/"><u>[New] Beyond the Lens  The Complete Selfie Confirmation on IG</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Elevating-Conversation-Confidentiality-Facebook’s-New-Direct-Messaging-Call-Services-with-End-to-End-Encryption"><a href="#Elevating-Conversation-Confidentiality-Facebook’s-New-Direct-Messaging-Call-Services-with-End-to-End-Encryption" class="headerlink" title="Elevating Conversation Confidentiality: Facebook’s New Direct Messaging &amp; Call Services with End-to-End Encryption"></a>Elevating Conversation Confidentiality: Facebook’s New Direct Messaging &amp; Call Services with End-to-End Encryption</h2><p> Facebook is expanding end-to-end encryption to Messenger voice and video calls, as well as direct messages (DMs) on Instagram. Turning on the feature will let users communicate securely, whether over calls or text messages.</p><h2 id="Facebook-Brings-End-to-End-Encryption-to-More-Services"><a href="#Facebook-Brings-End-to-End-Encryption-to-More-Services" class="headerlink" title="Facebook Brings End-to-End Encryption to More Services"></a>Facebook Brings End-to-End Encryption to More Services</h2><p> A post on <a class="link"   href="https://messengernews.fb.com/2021/08/13/messenger-updates-end-to-end-encrypted-chats-with-new-features/" >Messenger News <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> revealed that Facebook is amping up security on both Messenger and Instagram.<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/enjoy-secret-facebook-messenger-conversations/" >Facebook started offering encrypted messaging on Messenger in 2016 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and now that same protection is offered for voice and video calls.</p><p> Facebook noted that having end-to-end encryption “means that nobody else, including Facebook, can see or listen to what’s sent or said.” End-to-end encryption is put in place to prevent bad actors from listening in on phone calls and messages—it keeps the conversation between you and whoever you’re talking to.</p><p> The platform also announced that it’s testing end-to-end encrypted group chats and calls in Messenger. It’s even expanding the initiative to Instagram, where it’s testing end-to-end encryption for DMs. Facebook said that the test will be “limited,” and will only pertain to one-on-one conversations on the platform.</p><p> However, Instagram users will have to opt-in to end-to-end encryption, much like you have to do on Messenger. This has become a source of controversy, as some Messenger users think their conversations are protected, but fail to turn on the end-to-end encryption setting.</p><p> Unfortunately, this update doesn’t turn on end-to-end encryption by default on Messenger—you’ll still have to toggle the setting on for calls and texts.<a class="link"   href="https://www.messenger.com/privacy" >Messenger’s privacy page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> states that the app “will become end-to-end encrypted by default,” but it doesn’t look like that’s about to happen anytime soon.</p><p> Related:<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/facebook-messenger-end-to-end-encryption/" >When Is Facebook Messenger Going to Offer End-to-End Encryption? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Aside from expanding end-to-end encryption, Facebook also said that it’s giving users more control over their disappearing messages. Users in the chat can choose from a wider range of times when it comes to how long it takes for new messages to disappear.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Alert-Recover-Your-Compromised-FB-Profile-Now"><a href="#Alert-Recover-Your-Compromised-FB-Profile-Now" class="headerlink" title="Alert: Recover Your Compromised FB Profile Now"></a>Alert: Recover Your Compromised FB Profile Now</h2><p> Whether your Facebook account was hacked or you just forgot your password, Meta rarely offers more than a wall of silence. If you suspect that your Facebook password was leaked or that your account was compromised, act fast!</p><p> Facebook hackers could lock you out of your account and hassle your friends and family. Secure your Facebook account now and get it back before it’s too late. We’ll show you how.</p><h2 id="How-to-Tell-Whether-Your-Facebook-Account-Was-Hacked"><a href="#How-to-Tell-Whether-Your-Facebook-Account-Was-Hacked" class="headerlink" title="How to Tell Whether Your Facebook Account Was Hacked"></a>How to Tell Whether Your Facebook Account Was Hacked</h2><p> You can <a class="link"   href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/facebook-hacked-heres-tell-fix/" >tell your Facebook account was hacked <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you spot one of the following signs:</p><ul><li>You can no longer log in with your username and password.</li><li>A password reset email shows up in your inbox, but you didn’t initiate a reset.</li></ul><p> These are the most obvious signs something’s wrong, but there are more subtle ones. If a Facebook hacker gets into your account, they will leave a trace.</p><h3 id="Check-Your-Login-Sessions"><a href="#Check-Your-Login-Sessions" class="headerlink" title="Check Your Login Sessions"></a>Check Your Login Sessions</h3><p> Did someone log in from a location or device you’re not familiar with?</p><p> Log into your Facebook account and click your profile image in the top right to expand the Account menu. From that menu, pick<strong>Settings &amp; privacy &gt; Settings</strong> , open the<strong>Accounts Center</strong> from the sidebar, and select <a href="https://accountscenter.facebook.com/password%5Fand%5Fsecurity"><strong>Password and security</strong></a> . This path works on both desktop and mobile.</p><p> Under<strong>Security checks</strong> , expand the<strong>Where you’re logged in</strong> option, and select your account. Now you can review a comprehensive list of devices from which you’ve most recently logged into your Facebook account and when they were active. You can select each individually or all at once to log them out. Be sure to change your password before you remove a suspicious login.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/facebook-accounts-center-where-you-re-logged-in.jpg"                      alt="Facebook Accounts Center Where You&#39;re Logged In"                ></p><p>Other signs that your account may have been hacked include:</p><ul><li>Your personal data, including your password, email address, phone number, or name were changed by a third party. Within the <a href="https://accountscenter.facebook.com/"><strong>Accounts Center</strong></a> , go to<strong>Personal details</strong> and expand the<strong>Contact info</strong> option. Here you can see all email addresses and phone numbers associated with your account.</li><li>Friend requests and private messages were sent from your account without your doing. From your account menu (click your profile image in the top right), select<strong>Settings &amp; privacy &gt; Activity log</strong> and look through all the events logged here.</li><li>Your timeline contains posts you didn’t add or permit. To see your timeline, click your profile picture in the top right and select the profile you’d like to review.</li></ul><p> If you’re using Facebook to log into other applications, like Spotify or Instagram, we strongly recommend changing the respective logins or tightening your Facebook security to secure these third-party accounts.</p><p> If you spot any suspicious activity in your logins or have seen one or more of these other signs, you’ll find what you need to do below.</p><h2 id="What-to-Do-If-Your-Facebook-Account-Was-Hacked"><a href="#What-to-Do-If-Your-Facebook-Account-Was-Hacked" class="headerlink" title="What to Do If Your Facebook Account Was Hacked"></a>What to Do If Your Facebook Account Was Hacked</h2><p> If you have confirmed that your account has been compromised, here are the steps you should follow.</p><h3 id="1a-Change-Your-Facebook-Password"><a href="#1a-Change-Your-Facebook-Password" class="headerlink" title="1a. Change Your Facebook Password"></a>1a. Change Your Facebook Password</h3><p> In case your Facebook hacker hasn’t changed your password, you got lucky! Immediately update your password before you log out of suspicious sessions; you don’t want to alert the hacker. If it’s too late, head to step 1b.</p><p> To change your password from either your desktop or mobile device, go to<strong>Accounts Center</strong> , select<strong>Password and security,</strong> and then select<strong>Change password</strong> . Pick your account, enter your current password, set a strong new password, and click<strong>Change password</strong> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/facebook-account-center-change-password.jpg"                      alt="Facebook Account Center Change Password"                ></p><p> After a successful password change, you’ll see a<strong>Log out of other devices?</strong> screen pop up. Log out all suspicious sessions and click<strong>Log out</strong> .</p><p>Do this only if you’re sure you can log back in.</p><p> We recommend logging out completely, provided your contact details and security settings are up-to-date. You don’t want to jeopardize your means of logging back in. If you’re unsure, manually log out of all recent sessions that seem suspicious.</p><p> If you still think your account has been compromised, proceed to Step 3.</p><h3 id="1b-Reset-Your-Facebook-Password"><a href="#1b-Reset-Your-Facebook-Password" class="headerlink" title="1b. Reset Your Facebook Password"></a>1b. Reset Your Facebook Password</h3><p> If the hacker did change your password, and you need to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/recover-facebook-account-longer-log/" >recover your Facebook account <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , act quickly. Try to regain access, use the<strong>Forgot your password?</strong> link underneath the Facebook login.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/facebook-login-page.jpg"                      alt="Facebook Login Page"                ></p><p> This will let you retrieve your password in several ways. First, you’ll have to<strong>Find Your Account</strong> . You can either enter the email address you used to register with Facebook or any other secondary email address you added, as well as your phone number.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Find-Facebook-Account.png"                      alt="Facebook Find Your Account"                ></p><p> If Facebook can find your account, you can choose how to<strong>Reset Your Password</strong> .</p><p> If the hacker changed your email address, you should have received a message to the original address. Find this message because it contains a special link that will let you reverse the change and secure your account.</p><p> In my case, Facebook offered to send a recovery code to any of the email addresses I added to my account. We highly recommend that you specify multiple backup email addresses.</p><p> Remember that you must keep those accounts equally secure, at least by using a strong password and ideally by <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/what-is-two-factor-authentication-and-why-you-should-use-it/" >enabling two-factor authentication <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on your email accounts.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/facebook-password-recovery.jpg"                      alt="Facebook Password Recovery"                ></p><p> Use the<strong>Try another way</strong> link if you no longer have access to any of the offered email accounts. Facebook will offer to send a code to the phone numbers associated with your account. If none of those are viable, either, it’s nearly impossible to recover your account.</p><p> If you believe that the Facebook hacker who has access to your account has been abusing it, proceed to step 2.</p><h3 id="2-Report-the-Facebook-Hack"><a href="#2-Report-the-Facebook-Hack" class="headerlink" title="2. Report the Facebook Hack"></a>2. Report the Facebook Hack</h3><p> If your account was not only hacked, but is sending out ads and spam to your friends, you must report it as compromised to Facebook using <a class="link"   href="http://www.facebook.com/hacked/" >Facebook.com&#x2F;hacked&#x2F; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/facebook-hacked-report.jpg"                      alt="Facebook Hacked Report"                ></p><p> You can also use this in case you have lost access to your account by means of a phishing attack.
