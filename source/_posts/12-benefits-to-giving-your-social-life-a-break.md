## 12 Benefits to Giving Your Social Life a Break

 Scrolling through content and tapping their fingers on ads, some people think social media is a blessing. Unfortunately, it's not true all the time. Social media, sometimes, becomes pretty draining and is addictive physically and psychologically.

 The little positive reinforcement from a like or notification is enough to get us hooked. If you are feeling exhausted, it's probably time to put your devices away for a while.

 But should you take a break from social media, and is it worth it? Let's find out.

## Benefits of Withdrawing From Social Media

 Let's discuss the benefits of taking a little social media detox.

### 1\. It Lets You Embark on a Journey of Mindfulness

 The [effects of technology on our mental health](https://www.makeuseof.com/tech-effects-on-mental-health/) are undeniable. People who completely depend on social media for entertainment or to eliminate loneliness from their lives suffer from more compromised mental health in comparison to those who don't.

 Taking a break from social media helps reduce mental stress and anxiety. Your mental health is much more important than a couple of likes or comments on your posts.

 Also, looking at others and comparing them with your life is a stressful experience for some people. When you stop using social media for a while, it improves your health and peace of mind.

### 2\. Releases Stress ![A stressed out man](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/A-stressed-out-man.jpg)

 Stress from social media might come from various sources. The fear of missing out on the news, not getting enough reach on a post, and not getting your opinion respected and liked are some stress-inducing reasons.

 Taking a break from social media is the most tested cure for these stresses. The only solution is to just leave your socials for a while and use [apps that improve mental health](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-apps-to-improve-mental-health-iphone-android/) .

 Various studies have shown an indirect relationship between stress and excessive social media use. In a 2020 study posted on [MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/17/12/4566/htm) , 61 participants in a group were asked to stay away and not use social media for one week. After that time elapsed, a significant positive change was seen in the mood of the participants.

### 3\. Explore the Beauty of Nature ![man standing on top of a mountain](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Man-exploring-nature.jpg)

 If you are among those who prefer using a phone instead of going for outdoor activities, it's time to put your phone aside for some time. Instead of scrolling aimlessly through Twitter or Instagram, go for a walk.

 Go hiking, swimming, walking along the beach, jogging in the park, or sitting in the sun with friends and having drinks. Gardening is also considered a good way to pass the time by most people.

 This is just a concept. You do not need to [erase your social media presence](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/delete-social-media/) to appreciate nature. Take time out of your routine to appreciate the world we are living in.

### 4\. Say Goodbye to Anxiety Brought On by the Fear of Missing Out ![Woman sad and sitting on a beach](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Woman-sad-and-sitting-on-a-beach.jpg)

 Fear of missing out (FOMO) is a familiar feeling while scrolling through any social media platform. We tend to forget the golden rule of social media: everything is not as it seems.

 Who knows, maybe a person shopping from luxury brands and posting it on social media isn't as happy as he or she seems.

 Staying away from social media for a while can be beneficial as it removes the FOMO complex. Much of social media is about showing off achievements and accomplishments while hiding sadness and sorrow.

 Comparing ourselves to others often leads to depression and anxiety disorders, making us insecure. A limited social media user has healthier traits than a person with intense usage.

### 5\. Improved Brain Functioning

 People who use too much social media have the brain functionality of an addicted person. You may notice that getting more than expected likes and sharing gorgeous pictures or attention releases feelings of happiness. This feeling of pleasure is a dopamine release.

 People who rely too much on social media depend on it for their everyday solutions. It reduces their ability to think freely and solve any work-related or personal problems. Include healthy activities in your life and challenge your brain rather than using social media all day.

 A healthier brain means you have a better memory and creativity. It also regulates your emotions, helping you make wiser and more stable life decisions. People with healthy brains also have well-functioning body organs and an improved overall lifestyle.

 So, by reducing your time on social apps, you can get plenty of physical and mental health benefits.

### 6\. Spend Quality Time With Your Loved Ones ![Spending quality time](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Spending-quality-time-1.jpg)

 Spending time with family and friends should be a priority for everyone. Social media has made some people oblivious that the nearest family is supposed to come first, then the friends in real life, and then online friends.

 Take a break from the online world to avoid this critical yet common mistake. Spend time with family and check up on your friends. Take the spare time to party with the neighbors and show affection to your pets. Moments like these are never forgotten and often create bonds that are never broken.

 Also, it's a good idea to teach your kids the [negative effects of social media](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/negative-effects-social-media/) and that there is more to life than scrolling social media in the bedroom.

### 7\. More Time to Do Something Productive

 Spending less time online mostly results in productivity. Higher efficiency in studies, better results in work, and more time to take care of other matters are some of the positive effects of spending less time on social media.

 Finding yourself a hobby such as gardening, playing an instrument, writing, reading, or cycling is helpful for the growth of your mind and a great way to utilize time. Learning a skill such as graphic designing and programming can also be beneficial for you.

## Save Your Life by Taking a Break From Social Media

 Don't let your life, friends, and family slip away. The negativity in the online world has no restrictions, and itâ€™s better to avoid unnecessary arguments and to live a happy, peaceful life with no stress and worries of the online world.

 Take back control of your life, for it is too important to waste away. Use less social media and focus on something productive that leads to long-term physical and mental health benefits.
