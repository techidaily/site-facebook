## Tailoring Facebook View More Simplified Now

 If you're tired of seeing irrelevant posts on your Facebook feed, the social media platform is introducing new tools to help users customize what posts appear on their feed.

## Facebook Introduces New Feed Customization Tools

 Meta announced in a 5 October 2022 [press release](https://about.fb.com/news/2022/10/new-ways-to-customize-your-facebook-feed/) that it's rolling out more ways for Facebook users to customize their feeds, with options to show more or show less of specific types of content.

 This gives users a way to more effectively interact with Facebook's machine learning algorithm, as choosing the option to show more or less of a person or community's content affects that content's ranking.

As Meta notes in its announcement:

> Selecting Show more will temporarily increase the ranking score for that post and posts like it. If you select Show less, youâ€™ll temporarily decrease its ranking score.

 Initially, Facebook will roll out the option on certain posts. As the feature rolls out more progressively, you'll be able to select the three-dot menu on posts and choose the option to see more or less of that content.

 The company notes that it's testing this feature will Reels too, for those who want to [stop seeing Reels on Facebook](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-stop-seeing-reels-on-facebook/) , or at least get better recommendations. But it is also exploring ways to customize feed content from friends, groups, pages, and public figures. You will be able to access these options in your Feed Preferences.

 While both Twitter and Instagram have brought back chronological feed options, Facebook still relies solely on an algorithm-generated feed. This means that sometimes users see irrelevant content they're not interested in, while missing out on posts from those that are important to them.

 Other ways users can [clean up their Facebook account](https://www.makeuseof.com/ways-to-clean-up-facebook-account/) include snoozing posts from certain people, unfollowing irrelevant pages, and adding certain people to their Close Friends list.

## Get More Control Over Your Facebook Feed

 While the new features won't create a chronological or friends-only feed, they will help users get more control over the posts that Facebook recommends to them. Hopefully, more options will roll out to users in the future.
