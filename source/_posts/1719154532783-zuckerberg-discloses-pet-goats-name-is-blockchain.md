## Zuckerberg Discloses: Pet Goat's Name Is 'Blockchain'

 Mark Zuckerberg took to Facebook on Monday to share a photo of his goats. While one has the decidedly standard name Max, the other takes its name from the largest cryptocurrency: Bitcoin.

## Introducing Max and Bitcoin: Zuckerberg's Goat Pals

 In his [Facebook post](https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10112954515429031) , Zuckerberg shared a picture of his two goats called Max and Bitcoin.

 Bitcoin might be a digital currency of questionable worth, but now it also has the honor of sharing a name with one of Zuckerberg's animals.

 Curiously, the Facebook CEO didn't name the goat Diemâ€”that's what [Facebook's as-yet unreleased blockchain-based payment system](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-the-facebook-backed-diem-cryptocurrency-and-can-you-trust-it/) is called, formerly known as Libra.

 In a 2019 [Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/twitter-ceo-jack-dorsey-rolling-stone-interview-782298/) interview, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey recounted a story where Zuckerberg served a goat for dinner that he had killed. If Zuckerberg still kills his goats with "a laser gun", then Bitcoin should be worried; its life might be as volatile as the cryptocurrency.

 According to Dorsey, the goat that Zuckerberg dished up was cold, despite apparently being in the oven moments before. That's unfortunate catering from a man who enjoys smoking meats.

 We don't know whether Zuckerberg has a farmyard full of cryptocurrency animals. Perhaps he has a pig called Ethereum or a cow called Dogecoin?
