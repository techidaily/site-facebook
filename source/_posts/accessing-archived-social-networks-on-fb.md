## Accessing Archived Social Networks on FB

 Facebook allows you to connect with people from all over the world. When you are connected with someone, you can like and comment on the posts they publish, and vice versa.

 Throughout your time on Facebook, it is likely you've interacted with particular people a lot. Did you know that you can view your relationship history with a Facebook friend? If not, then read on.

## How to See Friendship With Your Facebook Friends

 It used to be that you'd have to manually find your friendship history with a friend by adding their profile username to your web address using "facebook.com/your-username/friend-username".

But that's more time-consuming than necessary.

 Instead, you can just use the See Friendship button on your friend's profile. Facebook does hide this away somewhat, so don't feel bad if you haven't come across it before. To find your friendship history with a friend on Facebook, do the following:

1. Head to the Facebook website and log in.
2. Search for a friend and visit their profile.
3. Click on the**ellipsis** icon and then depending on the device (PC/mobile) click or tap**See Friendship** .

 You should now be taken to the friendship history page for you and your Facebook friend.

 On the friendship history page, you'll be able to see your and your friend's**Things In Common** , such as**Pages** you've both liked,**Interests** you both have, or**Groups** you both are members of. It will also tell you how long you've been Facebook friends.

 In the main feed, you'll see all the posts that you have tagged each other in, or liked and commented on over the time you've been friends.

 It's a cool way to see how Facebook has been a part of your friendship, and can lead to some authentic positive reminiscence to your day. If you like the idea of looking back on your friendship history, you'll probably enjoy knowing [how to see every like, post, and comment you've made on Facebook](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/see-every-like-post-comment-you-made-facebook/) .

## Share the Memories With Your Facebook Friends

 Being able to see a feed dedicated to you and a particular Facebook friend is a pretty nifty feature and one that seems to be a positive use of social media. But why simply stop at checking out your friendship history? Share it with them!

 It can be hard speaking to a friend you haven't spoken to for years, but Facebook already makes it a bit easier to attempt to reconnect. What better way to do it than sending the link to your Friendship History page that particular friend?
