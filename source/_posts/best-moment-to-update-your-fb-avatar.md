## Best Moment to Update Your FB Avatar

 Are there any rules for when or how often you should change your profile picture on Facebook? Even if Facebook itself doesn’t have any specific rules about profile pictures, are there any unspoken expectations for when you should change it?

 Here are a few general guidelines for when to change your Facebook profile picture.

##

## 1\. When Your Appearance Significantly Changes ![Girl Taking Selfie](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IG-influencer.jpg)

 The main point of profile pictures is to help other users recognize you, so your picture should accurately represent what you look like. If you suddenly get a new haircut, start wearing glasses, or otherwise change your appearance, your profile picture should reflect this.

 If your current picture is from a few years ago, it also may no longer reflect the way you look, and it may be time to change it.

## 2\. When You Want to Be Consistent With Other Online Accounts

 Consistency is key! People will more easily recognize you online if you use the same profile picture for as many accounts as possible. Some examples would include consistency between Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Zoom, Gmail, and others. Of course, there might be some that are different. For example, you may be using your professional headshot on LinkedIn.

 If you have a lot of different profile pictures on other platforms, it is a good time to change your Facebook one to match the rest.

## 3\. Every Couple of Years

 Going back to the point about not using old pictures, you should change your Facebook profile picture every couple of years regardless of the other two rules just to reflect what you look like today.

 If you think it is time for a new picture, there are also tips you can explore on [how to choose the best Facebook profile picture](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-choose-the-facebook-profile-picture/) .

## 4\. Ultimately, Change Your Profile Picture Whenever You Want ![woman taking a selfie](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/woman-taking-a-selfie.jpg)

 Facebook has no rules about changing your profile picture, so you can really do it whenever you want. As long as it doesn’t break Facebook’s community guidelines, you can have whatever you want as your profile picture whenever you want it. Facebook does however, store old profile pictures.
