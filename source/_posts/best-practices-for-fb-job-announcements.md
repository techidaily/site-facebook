## Best Practices for FB Job Announcements

 Facebook is one of the most popular social networking platforms today. So, it isn't surprising that numerous employers use Facebook job postings to find potential employees.

 What makes these postings so great is that employers can explicitly target qualified candidates. And, if you have a business page on Facebook, you can post jobs relatively easily.

Here's how to do just thatâ€¦

## Facebook Job Posting Requirements

 Unfortunately, Facebook does not allow non-business accounts to post job ads. So, if you want to post an ad, you'll need to make a Facebook business page. This process is easy, but you will need to provide some details about your business.

To create a new business page, follow these steps:

1. On the Facebook app, tap on**Menu > Pages > Create** . On the website, you can press the**+** sign and click on**Pages** .
2. Fill in the name of your business, email address, phone number, and any other details following the prompts.
3. Click on**Create Page** .

To create a job post, here are the steps you should follow:

1. First, on the home page, go to**Create Post** and select**Create Job** .
2. Enter the job title, description, salary, location, and all other requirements. Make sure to give an accurate, detailed description of the position. You can also add photos and custom questions to make your job ad more appealing.
3. Press**Continue** to post your job ad.
4. To further promote your ad, toggle the sliding button for**Boost Post** to the right. This step is optional, and boosting a post isn't free.

 If you decide to boost your post, adjust your budget with the slider shown, or edit the duration of the promotion. Facebook will automatically give you an estimate of the number of people your job ad will reach and the cost. Choose your budget and tap**Boost Job Now** to pay.

## Does It Cost Anything to Post a Job on Facebook?

 Fortunately, posting a basic job ad on Facebook is completely free, which is good news for those on a tight budget. You'll only pay if you want to promote your ad by boosting the post.

 The promotion price varies according to the time you'd like to promote your ad and the number of people you'd like to reach. Target details can also include options like location, education, and experience level.

 Additionally, you can set up a budget for your business and then choose target options to boost your ad within that budget. Longer promotions or a more specific target market will increase the overall cost.

## What Makes a Good Facebook Job Ad?

 Thousands of businesses are using social media to search for their next great employee, but it isn't always easy to find the perfect candidate. So, what can you do to streamline the hiring process and find your next rock star hire?

 While creating your job ad, your priority should be to make the position look desirable to applicants. Therefore, try to keep it short and sweet instead of adding a lot of fluff. Shorter sentences and concise language will demonstrate professionalism. On the other hand, unnecessary information and vague language may cause some to ignore your job post.

 You can also add relevant images to give viewers a visual idea of the workspace and workplace culture. Photos add to the authenticity of your business. To add another layer of trust, you can also have your Facebook business page verified.

 For smaller businesses that can't afford Facebook's boosting service, free ads can still work well. You can also have Facebook friends share your ad on their profile. Doing so will help reach a wider pool of potential candidates.

## Enjoy a Successful Hiring Run With Facebook

 In conclusion, creating a job ad on Facebook is completely free. All you need is a business page. But if you want to promote or boost a job ad, you will have to spend some money. If that is not an option, you can always have your network share the post to maximize the reach.

 Facebook has more than 2 billion monthly users, making it the ideal platform to find large numbers of qualified employees. In addition, the job posting process has proven to be a successful method for many businesses needing exceptional candidates.

 And the best part is that Facebook's job posting process is easy to use and can help improve recruiting for your business.
