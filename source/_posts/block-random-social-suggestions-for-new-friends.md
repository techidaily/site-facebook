 Many of us would rather scroll through our Facebook feeds without having to deal with friend suggestions. Luckily, you can hide the "People You May Know" feature.

## How Does Facebook Come Up With Its Friend Suggestions?

 Facebook uses its engagement algorithms, your uploaded contact lists, and existing friends to suggest lists of people it believes you may know. You find some of these people in your News Feed under the "People You May Know" gallery.

 It's in Facebook's interest to suggest Facebook friends for you. The more connections you have on the platform, the more likely you are to use it. However, if you're not looking to add new friends on Facebook, the feature could become redundant and better off hidden.

## How to Hide the "People You May Know" Feature on Facebook

 Facebook does not support permanent disabling of the "People You May Know" feature. But it allows you to hide it temporarily. Hiding the slider keeps it from coming up on your News feed for a while.

 Here's how to hide the "People You May Know" feature on Facebook:

1. Launch the Facebook app on your device.
2. Scroll until you find the**People You May Know** slider.
3. Tap on the**three dots** in the top-right corner of the slider.
4. Tap on**Hide People You May Know** .

 While Facebook does not specify how long the feature stays hidden, it does take a while before it returns.

 You have the option to either turn off each type of notification (Push, Email, and SMS). You can also disable all the notifications by turning off the**Allow Notifications on Facebook** toggle.

 Once you've disabled this feature and these alerts, you should be able to navigate Facebook in peace. Unfortunately, while switching off alerts is permanent, you'll have to hide the friend suggestions box again when it reappears in your feed.
