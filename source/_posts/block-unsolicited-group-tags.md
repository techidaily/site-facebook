## Block Unsolicited Group Tags

 Getting mentioned in a group used to usually mean a friend was tagging you to see something interesting, but not anymore. Facebook empowered group admins to tag every group member in a post by simply using the "@everyone" tag.

 If you don't want to receive these batch notifications, we've got you covered. Read on to learn how to turn off the annoying @everyone tag on Facebook.

## How to Turn Off the @everyone Tag on Facebook

 Here's how to turn off the pesky notifications without [leaving a Facebook group](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-leave-a-facebook-group/) :

Close

1. Log in to Facebook and navigate to**Settings** .
2. Tap on**Notifications** .
3. Select**Tags** .
4. Tap the**Batch @everyone mentions** toggle to turn it off.

 That's all there is to it. You'll no longer receive notifications when someone uses the @everyone tag in a group post. You can further customize the notifications you receive on the**Notifications Settings** page to receive even fewer notifications.

## Why You Should Turn Off @everyone Tags on Facebook

 The @everyone feature is popular with Facebook groups because it allows admins to alert members of important news or events. It's also helpful when admins want to [start a discussion with everyone in a Facebook group](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-mention-all-members-facebook-group/) .

 However, this feature can be abused by some admins. It can be used to send out unsolicited notifications, which can be disruptive and even spammy if done too often.

 Turning off the Batch @everyone mentions toggle can be a great way to take control of your notifications and stop getting spammed by overzealous group admins. You will still get notified of personal tags, so you won't miss any vital conversations.

## Take Control of Your Facebook Tags

 You can control your notifications and decide which tags you want to receive. Just follow the steps above, and you'll be able to customize your notifications settings in no time.

 You don't have to leave the group or mute the conversation if you don't want toâ€”just turn off the Batch @everyone mentions toggle and be done with it.
