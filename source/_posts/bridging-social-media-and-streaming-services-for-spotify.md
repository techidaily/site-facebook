## Bridging Social Media and Streaming Services for Spotify

 When your friends would share their favorite tracks from Spotify to Facebook, you used to have to switch between the apps to listen. Now, the Spotify miniplayer allows you to play music that has been shared through Facebook and continue scrolling through your social feed.

 We're going to explain what the Spotify miniplayer is, how to use it, and what features premium and free users get while using the feature on Facebook.

## What Is the Spotify Miniplayer?

 Before the Spotify miniplayer, sharing songs from Spotify directly to Facebook had a bit of an issue. Instead of being able to listen to the shared music in your Facebook app, you would automatically be taken to the Spotify app.

 Those days are over as Spotify has created a way for you to listen to any shared song in the Facebook app. You can scroll through your news feed and navigate throughout the app while still being able to listen to your music.

## Who Can Use the Spotify Miniplayer?

 Anyone with a Spotify account is able to use the miniplayer. The features you have will depend on [the Spotify subscription that you have](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/which-spotify-subscription-is-best/) .

 Free users have access to the miniplayer, except they are only allowed to listen on shuffle. So once the shared song is done playing through Facebook, you don't have any control over what plays next. Ads will also be peppered in between songs just like they would on the Spotify app.

 Premium users will enjoy free rein when using their Spotify miniplayer. The feature offers full control over playability and which songs you listen to. There are also no ads interjected between tunes for premium users.

 Once you find a shared track in your news feed, click the track to listen like you normally would.

 If it's your first time using the miniplayer, you will receive a prompt asking for consent to use the feature.

 Once accepted, a small player will appear at the bottom of your screen where you can pause, play, and control track shuffling. Now you can scroll through your feed and browse Facebook without switching to the Spotify app.

 If you're concerned about what is being shared between Spotify and Facebook, there are ways you can [limit the amount of data that Facebook shares with Spotify](https://www.makeuseof.com/stop-facebook-sharing-data-with-spotify/) .

## Listen to Spotify Using the Facebook App

 With the Spotify miniplayer, you can listen to tracks your friends share through the Facebook app without switching back and forth. Premium users will have no interruptions but free Spotify subscribers will have ads with limited shuffle only.

 There are plenty of tricks to learn about the Spotify app to get the most out of the platform.
