## Building a Robust Client Base Using Social Media's Platform: FB

 Businesses and professionals commonly use LinkedIn to find the right hire, but Facebook is also picking up the pace. Considering Facebook has more than 3 billion users, and the popularity of professional Facebook groups is increasing with time, it is an excellent platform for finding clients.

 In this article, you'll learn how to customize your Facebook profile, create a Facebook page, advertise on Facebook groups, and use Facebook ads to land a high-paying position.

## 1\. Make Your Profile Professional ![Properly Set Up Facebook Profile](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Properly-Set-Up-Facebook-Profile.jpg)

 Start by posting a professional profile picture that clearly shows your face and is in decent clothing. Add a cover photo that reflects your expertise and services. After that, customize your Facebook profile URL, preferably by adding your name.

 The next step should be to set up your**About** page. To do so, start by adding your academic and work information, including the schools and colleges you attended and companies you have worked for in the past. You should also include your contact information and a link to your personal website, if you have one.

 Furthermore, adding life events highlighting your achievements and awards will enhance your credibility. Regularly include these events as they occur. Also, linking your LinkedIn and other professional profiles to Facebook makes you more trustworthy.

 Last but not least, remove anything immature from your check-ins and delete all the videos and images you have added that could degrade your reputation as a professional or give your client a reason to second-guess your professionalism. You should also periodically review your profile to make sure it stands out from the competition.

## 2\. Brand Yourself With a Facebook Page ![Properly Set Up Facebook Page](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Properly-Set-Up-Facebook-Page.jpg)

 You are definitely on the right track by [creating a work-focused Facebook page](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-create-a-facebook-business-page/) , but how well you set it up and use it is equally important. Set up your brand's profile and cover photo, include a call-to-action button, and elaborate on your goals as a brand in the about section.

 Then, share relevant content regularly on your page, pin important or most popular posts, respond to comments immediately, engage well with your audience, and, most importantly, try to increase your fan base consistently. Even if you have to promote your page to get more followers, consider doing that. Having more followers will make you appear more knowledgeable on the subject, and your chances of winning clients will also increase.

 Another advantage of having a Facebook page is that you can lock your personal profile that you use to socialize, share memes, have fun with your friends and do activities that could impede your professional success on the platform. Furthermore, even those not on Facebook will have access to your page, which increases your chances of landing good clients. It is therefore essential to have a Facebook page.

## 3\. Join Facebook Groups ![Searching For SEO Groups on Facebook](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Searching-For-SEO-Groups-on-Facebook-1.jpg)

 Joining too many groups at once is a bad idea. Instead, after filtering deeply,[join a few Facebook groups](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/5-awesome-ways-discover-new-facebook-groups/) relevant to your niche and spend some time observing the audience's behavior. It is helpful to do a bit of backhand research to confirm you're targeting the right audience before you put in your extra effort.

 Then, once you have confirmed your ideal clients are in the group, introduce yourself, tell the group what you do, describe your expertise, and invite others involved in the same field to interact. Make sure not to be too pushy or start marketing your services right away, as that will not make the right first impression, and you will likely be banned right away.

 Share one or two posts a day that provides value for others, regularly follow up on your comments, and stay consistent. Do your best to engage with other people's posts as much as possible. Perhaps a tiny conversation will lead to a long-term contract. Be specific, relevant, and clear in your communication with the group to not overwhelm them with your thoughts and ideas.

 Share your learning experiences in the group, your efforts to level up your skillset, the big projects you're working on, and client feedback. All of this will demonstrate your commitment and professionalism. It's a no-brainer that relevant people will approach you once you establish your credibility. Once they land in your inbox, it's your job to convert them.

 Even after getting regular work, you must interact at the same pace in the group. Doing so will help foster your relationship with the community along with increasing your chances of winning more clients. Maintaining and growing engagement in the group is the key you should always strive for.

## 4\. Start Your Own Facebook Group

 A Facebook group is a way to build a community around yourself. Each group member is your follower, and having thousands of followers increases your credibility. You would no longer be seen as an individual, but as a community leader, which increases your chances of getting hired.

 Furthermore, having a Facebook group allows you to run the community by your own rules, reach out to your target audience without getting banned, market your product and services the way you want, leverage the group audience to sell your products. And most importantly, you can easily convert your potential clients who are part of your group.

 However, managing your group is more complex than communicating in other groups. It will take more time for you to engage with your audience, share posts, ban those who violate the group rules, and respond to people's concerns and issues.

 It may be possible to have a group manager handle the job for you, but your input and time would still be required. Ensure you have the time and resources to manage your group before starting it. With all the perks and career growth that come with building a community, running a Facebook group is worth it.

## 5\. Leverage Facebook Ads ![Running a Campaign on Facebook Ads Account](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Running-a-Compaign-on-Facebook-Ads-Account.jpg)

 Creating a professional profile, growing a branded page, interacting with other's groups, and growing your personal group can help you find clients organically. But, advertising your services via Facebook ads holds a higher chance of connecting you with the right clients more quickly.

 In comparison with other methods, where you need to put in a lot of effort to build your credibility, Facebook ads give you the chance to start reaching out to your potential clients right away. All you need is some cash to pay for the ads, a well-designed landing page or website, and a manager to follow up with all the leads.

 Moreover, you can control your ad spend to either increase or decrease the pace of finding more clients and avoid putting so much effort into finding them organically. Therefore, if you can afford to invest money in marketing yourself and your business, don't forget to use Facebook ads.

## Get More Clients on Facebook

 Hopefully, by following the tips covered in the list, you'll be able to get connected to the right clients. To convert them better, you may need to improve your communication skills. Sharpen your skills to win high-paying clients and start getting regular work.

 Try your luck on Facebook, but don't limit yourself to just one platform. It's crucial to have a varied client base. Regardless of whether your efforts succeed or not on Facebook, it will be best if you promote yourself on LinkedIn, too, since the chances of getting long-term clients are higher there.
