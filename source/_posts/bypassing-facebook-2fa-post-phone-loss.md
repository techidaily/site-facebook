## Bypassing Facebook 2FA Post-Phone Loss

 Two-factor authentication is a simple and effective security measure, present across platforms, from banks to social networks.

 However, if your phone is a part of the verification process and you lose it, getting back into an account can be tricky. But it isn’t impossible.

 Two-factor authentication on Facebook—or Meta—is the same. It’s easy to activate and disable if you can log in. You can also take steps to avoid locking yourself out, but even if you do, there are ways to jump straight into your profile.

 Here’s everything you need to know about how to bypass Facebook’s two-factor authentication system without even logging in.

## What Is Two-Factor Authentication and Why Have It on Facebook?

 There are actually five factors of authentication that cybersecurity systems use to verify someone’s identity, the first three being the most popular:

* Something you have.
* Something you know.
* Something you are.
* Somewhere you are.
* Something you do.

 So,[what is two-factor authentication](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/what-is-two-factor-authentication-and-why-you-should-use-it/) ? It’s a security process that uses two of these five factors to quickly verify a Facebook user's identity, for example.

 It typically asks for a password you know and a code sent to a device you own. If that’s your phone, you’ll get the code via text message or a Facebook-compatible authentication app like [Google Authenticator](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU2010808/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&gl=) .

 Be careful about the [differences between two-factor authentication and two-step verification](https://www.makeuseof.com/two-factor-authentication-two-step-verification-meaning/) . The latter tends to ask for two steps of the same factor. For example, it can ask for a password and the answer to a security question.

 But the two terms are used interchangeably and, while it's not the term Facebook uses, if you ask around about how to turn off two-step verification without signing in, you may come across the same answers.

 So why does Facebook even have two-factor authentication? Unfortunately, it’s because cybercriminals love to impersonate other people on Facebook. And stealing a user’s password to access their profile is one way to do that.

 Extra security measures are there to protect you and your contacts. If you want to know more about these, explore our [Facebook security checklist](https://giveaway.makeuseof.com/facebook-checklist) . For now, keep learning how to bypass or turn off two-factor authentication on Facebook by and without logging in.

## How to Ensure You Don’t Lock Yourself Out With Two-Factor Authentication on Facebook

 It only takes a few clicks to set up and [use Facebook’s two-factor authentication](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-use-facebook-login-approvals-code-generator-android/) , but pay special attention to your various options.

 First off, go to **Settings and Privacy > Settings > Security and Login > Two-factor authentication** on your browser-based Facebook account. You’ll find a list of your authorized devices where you won’t need to use a login code. It’s worth checking these and adding a second phone, for example.

 As soon as you set up your two-factor authentication measure, you can also choose backup methods in case you lose your phone or just change devices.

Your options are:

* Authentication app.
* Security key.
* Recovery codes.

 Click**Set Up** next to the method you prefer and keep your key or codes in a safe place. You can always come back and change your settings.

## How to Disable Two-Factor Authentication on Facebook Without Your Phone

 Assuming you did set up a backup method and you can log in to your Facebook account via a different browser or device, go back to your**Security and Login** settings.

 Click anywhere in the**Use two-factor authentication** field to open the activated feature’s settings, where you can edit your security and backup methods.

 Now you need to know how to turn off Facebook’s two-factor authentication. It's simple: click the**Turn off** button and confirm your choice once more to disable the feature.

 But what do you do if you don’t have a backup method? There’s no reason to panic because Facebook and a few other tricks have you covered.

## How to Bypass Two-Factor Authentication on Facebook When Locked Out

 So, your phone is lost or broken, and you didn’t set up a backup method, but you need to get through your two-factor authentication.

 While [Facebook’s Help Centre](https://www.facebook.com/help/147926301947841?helpref=faq%5Fcontent) does give some tips, you may need a bit more troubleshooting detail that doesn't involve Facebook's code generator bypass, for example.

 In 2023, Facebook removed its trusted contacts feature, but how to remove two-factor authentication on Facebook despite a lost phone still has a few solutions. Here are the best ways to log in without your phone and without your security measures getting in the way.

### 1\. Log In Through a Recognized Device or Location ![who has signed into your facebook account](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/authorized-logins-list-in-facebook-s-two-factor-authentication-settings.jpg)

 If you regularly use Facebook on your computer, tablet, and phone, especially with your two-factor authentication active, the app will recognize all these devices and locations. This is why you should check and remember that list.

 Go onto any of your other recognized devices, and Facebook will log you in automatically. Then, follow the steps above to disable your two-factor authentication or change its settings.

### 2\. Provide an Email Address and Form of ID

 This process can take longer than the rest, but it’s an official method to log in without your phone.

 After you give your password and Facebook asks for the code it sent to your device—which you don’t have anymore—go straight to the**Didn’t receive a code?** tab at the bottom.

A window opens that offers the following choices:

* Approve from another device.
* Use a text message.
* Other options.

 You want the last section, which will start a different process to confirm your identity. On there, click the**Get More Help** button.

![what happens if you never got a 2fa code meta](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/facebook-two-factor-authentication-didnt-receive-code-options.jpg)

 The next window informs you that you will be providing an email address and government-issued ID. You get 13 options for the latter, including:

* Passport.
* Driving license.
* National ID card.
* Marriage certificate.
* Voter ID card.

 All you do is take a picture of your ID using your webcam and submit it for review, which should take no more than two days to complete. If your details check out, Facebook will give you access to your account.

### 3\. Change Your Password

 There are many ways to [recover your Facebook account when you can’t log in](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/recover-facebook-account-longer-log/) , but this is the simplest. To access your Facebook account without your phone and despite its two-factor authentication, try changing your password.

 When asked for it, click the**Forgotten password?** tab instead and confirm your email address, so Facebook can send you a code to reset your password.

 As soon as you do that, Facebook should automatically log you in and you can make any changes you need to your two-factor authentication settings.

## Get to Know Why Two-Factor and Other User Authentication Methods Are Important

 Two-factor authentication on Facebook can be a hassle, but it’s a great way to keep hackers at bay. If you set it up carefully, using it will become second nature and you won’t lock yourself out if you lose your phone.

 That said, it’s a good idea to learn more about processes that verify users’ identities, whether on Facebook or elsewhere. What goes on in the background is complex, but the more you understand, the easier it’ll be to make the right decisions when it comes to your cybersecurity.

 You'll also learn to solve problems like how to bypass two-factor authentication with or without your phone by instinct instead of hunting for answers all over the internet.
