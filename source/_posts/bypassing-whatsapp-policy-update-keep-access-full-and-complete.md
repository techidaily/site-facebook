## Bypassing WhatsApp Policy Update, Keep Access Full and Complete

 WhatsApp's new privacy policy has managed to create quite a bit of controversy since the company [first announced it in early 2021](https://www.makeuseof.com/whatsapp-forces-share-data-with-facebook/) . Following user backlash, WhatsApp delayed the rollout of its new privacy until mid-May.

 The company planned to limit WhatsApp users' account functionality who did not accept its new privacy policy by May 15th. However, the company has now had a change of heart.

## WhatsApp Reverses Its Stance on Limiting Account Functionality

 In a statement to [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/28/22458805/whatsapp-privacy-policy-no-plans-limit-functionality) , WhatsApp says that it will not limit the account functionality of users who do not accept its new privacy policy. The company will be sticking to this stance going forward. Below is the statement issued by WhatsApp:

> Given recent discussions with various authorities and privacy experts, we want to make clear that we will not limit the functionality of how WhatsApp works for those who have not yet accepted the update.

 WhatsApp will continue to remind users about its new privacy policy, though. The company wants to give its users more choice with this move.

> We will continue to remind users from time to time and let them accept the update, including when they choose to use relevant optional features like communicating with a business that is receiving support from Facebook. We hope this approach reinforces the choice that all users have whether or not they want to interact with a business.‚Äù

 After initially delaying the rollout of the new privacy policy until May 15th, WhatsApp had stated that it would eventually delete accounts that do not accept the updated privacy policy. A week before the mid-May deadline,[WhatsApp reversed its stance](https://www.makeuseof.com/whatsapp-drops-may-15-deadline-accepting-new-privacy-policy/) , saying it won't delete accounts that do not accept the changes, though it would start limiting their functionality.

 The limited functionality would have included WhatsApp showing a persistent notification about its new privacy policy to users. It would then prevent users from accessing their chat list, though they would still have been able to answer incoming voice and video calls. Users would have also been able to read and respond to missed calls or messages via notifications.

 Eventually, though, WhatsApp would revoke an account's ability to receive incoming calls and messages, rendering the messaging platform inaccessible for users who do not accept its new privacy policy.

## WhatsApp's New Privacy Policy Has Been Controversial

 The whole controversy around WhatsApp's new privacy policy has been related to the company sharing more user data with Facebook. However, WhatsApp has repeatedly denied this saying the new privacy policy will only [share one's communication data with businesses](https://www.makeuseof.com/whatsapp-delays-privacy-policy-facebook-data-sharing-controversy/) , which Facebook could use for marketing purposes.
