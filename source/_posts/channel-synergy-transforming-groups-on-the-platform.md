## Channel Synergy: Transforming Groups on the Platform

 Every day, millions of Facebook users engage in groups. But because they can be so large, it's easy to get left behind if you don't drop in often. For this reason, the best way to stay engaged and get value from the groups you're a part of is through smaller communities within Facebook Groups.Facebook realizes this; that's why it has rolled out channels to make it easier to keep up with the topics you're interested in. This article will cover how channels make it easier to connect in Facebook Groups.

## Facebook Introduces Group Channels

 Facebook has added channels to Groups to make it easier to connect. Channels are customizable, and they create multiple points of engagement. Facebook announced the Group Channels feature in a [Meta blog post](https://about.fb.com/news/2022/06/features-to-find-and-connect-with-facebook-groups/) , which read:

> Admins can begin to create channels to connect with their groups in smaller, more casual settings where they can have deeper discussions on common interests or organize their communities around topics in different formats.

 Facebook Groups can be pretty broad, so it helps to connect in smaller channels. That allows you to interact around topics that appeal to you. If you find channels you enjoy, you can [share the links to those Facebook Groups](https://www.makeuseof.com/facebook-find-links-profiles-pages-groups/) with friends that have common interests.

 Channels ensure that important messages aren't lost among casual or unimportant chats, which can clog up a group and your notifications. Let's look at how channels make it easier to connect in Facebook Groups.

## Community Feed Channels ![facebook community feed channels](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/facebook-community-feed-channels.jpg)

 Remember the Community tab in Facebook Groups? Community feed channels are a step up from that. The Community tab allowed group members to have broad, unstructured discussions.

 Community feed channels, however, will be specific to certain topics so that other members don't have to read messages they aren't interested in. The feature gives you more options so that you're more likely to find a community you can relate to in the groups you're part of. But if you're tired of the same old groups you have, you can [discover new Facebook Groups](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/5-awesome-ways-discover-new-facebook-groups/) to connect with.

## Community Chat Channels

 These channels work on both Groups and Messenger. They reduce clutter in Groups by allowing members to connect on sub-topics that might not interest everyone in the group.

 If you join a Community Chat Channel and your phone won't stop buzzing, you can mute notifications for that period. Our guide on [managing Facebook Messenger Group notifications](https://www.makeuseof.com/manage-facebook-messenger-group-notifications/) could also come in handy.

## Community Audio Channels

 Similar to the social audio app Clubhouseâ€”this feature allows members to drop in on audio discussions in a group and leave without disturbing the flow. Some things are better explained (or understood) via audio. Listen to members find solutions to problems you're experiencing with your new tech device.

 Have you attempted a recipe you found in a baking group? Find out about other members' experiences baking the same cake. The appeal of Community Audio Channels is that you can interact with others in real-time. And who knows? You might end up making new friends. Not sure how to connect with them on Facebook?

## Find More Ways to Connect in Facebook Groups

 Facebook has expanded how you can connect in groups, giving you more options to participate. Consider revisiting the groups you haven't opened in a while to see if you'd be interested in any of its channels.

 If you're a group admin, add relevant and interesting channels to make your group more appealing and to add value to members. This could increase engagement and attract more Facebook users to join as word spreads about your channels.
