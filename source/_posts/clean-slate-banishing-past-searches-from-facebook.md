## Clean Slate: Banishing Past Searches From Facebook

 Like most online platforms, Facebook is saving your entire search history, but you can easily delete individual searches or wipe your entire search history from your phone or browser.

 Much has been written about just how much Facebook knows about you. With its ever-evolving privacy settings, it can be hard to figure out where to go to find the settings you want. Clearing your search history is certainly no exception.

## How to Clear Your Facebook Search History

 If you tend to visit Facebook in a browser, you can wipe your search history by the following methods.

### 1\. Through the Facebook Search Bar

 The simplest way to clear your Facebook search history is to use the search bar. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Open Facebook on your browser and click on**Search Facebook** (located in the top-left corner).
2. Here, you will see the recent searches. To delete individual searches, you can simply click on the**cross icon** beside them.

3. Alternatively, click on**Edit** . Doing so takes you to the activity log.
4. To wipe the entire search history, click on**Clear searches** . For deleting only a single search, click on the**three-dot icon** and then**Delete** .

### 2\. From Your Profile Page

 You can also delete the search history by going to the activity log from your profile page.

1. On your profile page, click the**three-dot icon** . In a browser, the button is on the right-hand side.
2. Select**Activity log** from the menu.
