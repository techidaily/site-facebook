## Comparing Profiles & Ppages: Why Brands Thrive with the Right Choice

 Facebook is one of the top social media channels for building and growing brands for businesses around the globe. To build your personal or business brand on Facebook, you can leverage your Facebook profile or your Facebook Page.

 As each option has its upsides and downsides, we will look at eight reasons why a Facebook Page is better than a Facebook profile for business branding.

## 1\. Ease of Getting Followers

 Growing a following on your Facebook Page is easier than doing so on your Facebook profile. Facebook allows you to run paid ads to get more followers for your Facebook Page. With a higher ad spend, you can gain more followers and promote your page for as long as you want.

 Sadly, this isn't possible with a Facebook profile. Thus, you have to rely on Facebook's algorithm and the organic reach of the content on your Facebook profile to boost your following.

 Because of how quickly your following can grow on your Facebook Page, you would be better off creating a Facebook Page for your business.

## 2\. Ability to Add a CTA Button ![Adding a CTA Button on Facebook Business Page](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/1-Adding-a-CTA-Button-on-Facebook-Business-Page.jpg)

 A CTA button is a path that leads your followers to your desired destination, be it your website, a landing page, or your brand store. Facebook users can add a call-to-action button to Facebook Pages, but they cannot do this on their profiles.

 Considering the amount of traffic you can drive to your shop or website, a CTA button gives you an edge when running a brand on a Facebook Page compared to a Facebook profile.

## 3\. Flexible Management With Multiple Page Roles ![Changing Page Roles on Facebook Page](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/2-Changing-Page-Roles-on-Facebook-Page.jpg)

 It is much easier to operate your business with a Facebook Page than with a Facebook profile. You can assign roles to your team on your Facebook Pages, such as editor, moderator, and jobs manager. Every role on your business page has a restricted set of permissions.

 Therefore, you can have multiple people respond to customer requests, create content and share it,[handle job postings and applications](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-post-a-job-ad-on-facebook/) , run and manage advertising campaigns, and engage your audience.

 In contrast, multiple people cannot manage a single Facebook account, and the option to define different roles on a Facebook profile does not exist.

 Hence, considering the flexibility of managing a Facebook Page for business, it is the ideal choice for building your brand.

## 4\. Access to Analytics ![Facebook Page Insights](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/3-Facebook-Page-Insights.jpg)

 One of the advantages of handling your business through a Facebook Page is that you can monitor the page's performance using Audience Insights. You can track the reach of your page, the performance of your content, demographic data, and the gender/age group of your audience.

 On the other hand, you can't track this activity on your Facebook profile. Although you can manually track how your posts are performing, no data collection tool tracks your audience's age, gender, demographics, or anything else, as they interact with content shared through your profile.

 As a result, having a Facebook Page for your business helps you gauge your audience's behavior, monitor its progress, and take steps when necessary. Analytics data can assist you in planning your business strategy and directing your efforts in the right direction for your business' success.

 As opposed to that, you'll be blindfolded by Facebook when you do the same with your profile. A Facebook Page is, therefore, a better choice.

## 5\. No Restrictions on Creating Multiple Pages

[Facebook states](http://web.facebook.com/help/975828035803295?%5Frdc=1&%5Frdr) that users cannot maintain multiple Facebook accounts simultaneously, and it's against its Community Standards to do so.

 As a result, you'll need to revamp your profile for business use since you can't create another account on top of your existing one. Moreover, if you plan to run more than one business, you will need to use the same profile, making managing both businesses more challenging.

 Conversely, you may create as many pages as you wish on Facebook. Consequently, you can run multiple pages, projects, or businesses simultaneously. Thus, if you run or plan to run multiple businesses, it's best to use Facebook Pages.

## 6\. Selling Products With Facebook Shops

 Since its launch, Facebook Shops has gained enormous popularity and has enabled online sellers to easily list their products on their shops and market them to billions of people worldwide. Opening your store opens the door to new customers, increasing your revenue and brand growth.

 However,[you must have a Facebook Page](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-create-a-facebook-business-page/) to run a shop on the platform. If you don't have one, you need to create one when setting up your shop.

 The fact that you cannot create a personal store on Facebook using your profile makes using a Facebook Page a more viable option to grow your brand. So, if you plan to sell products through Facebook Shops now or in the future, it would be best to start your branding with a Facebook Page.

## 7\. Easy to Embed ![Extracting the Embed Code From Facebook Developers](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/4-Extracting-the-Embed-Code-From-Facebook-Developers.jpg)

 Facebook makes it convenient for business owners to [embed their Facebook Pages on their websites](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/add-facebook-widgets-buttons-website/) . Therefore, any new deal or event you plan to advertise on your Facebook Page, or any critical announcement you want to share with your website audience, you can do so right away by embedding it directly on your site.

 Furthermore, as you can easily cross-post the messages shared on your Facebook Page, you can drive traffic from your website to your Facebook business page. By doing so, you can expand your influence on social media.

 Additionally, having a Facebook Page gives your business website an SEO boost that improves its authority in the eyes of search engines which increases the chances of receiving more organic traffic.

 Sadly, the same does not apply to Facebook profiles. So, to keep things streamlined, it's best to use the business page instead of a personal profile.

## 8\. Access to Facebook Business Apps ![Facebook Business Apps to add on Facebook](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/5-Facebook-Business-Apps-to-add-on-Facebook.jpg)

 Having a Facebook Page also opens the door for hundreds of apps to streamline your business processes. Whether you [create content with design tools like Canva](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-canva-beginners-guide/) or sell your products with eCommerce apps like BigCommerce, you can connect them with your Facebook business page to run your business efficiently.

 It isn't possible to connect these apps to your Facebook profile. Thus, the availability of third-party apps makes Facebook Pages a better choice for your brand.

## Grow Your Business With Facebook Pages

 Business owners can benefit significantly from a Facebook Page, so it's best to create and use it to handle all of your business operations rather than a Facebook profile.

 Having a Facebook Page will undoubtedly establish your authority and make your business more recognizable and trustworthy.

 For those who have built a substantial following on their Facebook profiles, it makes the most sense to convert a Facebook profile into a Facebook Page and then use it for business purposes.
