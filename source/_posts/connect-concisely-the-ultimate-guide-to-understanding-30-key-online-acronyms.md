## Connect Concisely: The Ultimate Guide to Understanding 30 Key Online Acronyms

 If you've ever been bewildered by the abbreviations you've seen on social media, you're not alone. After all, social media is a different world with a different language.

 Most abbreviations are common across social media platforms, so chances are you've seen a few pop up on more than one app. Here are some of the most common abbreviations used on social media.

## 1\. POV

 POV stands for "point of view". It tells the viewer of a video that you should imagine yourself in the position of the description. It gives short, concise, and interesting context to a video.

 For example, a video saying "POV: You have no more chores to do" indicates that you should imagine a person in that position for the context of the video.

## 2\. FYP

 FYP is short for "For You Page", which is TikTok's personal recommendations feed. It shows you what it thinks you'll like based on the content you already enjoy. Every TikTok creator wants their videos to be featured on the FYP. In fact, the #FYP hashtag on TikTok had 49,775.4 billion views at the time of writing.

## 3\. IYKYK

 IYKYK stands for "if you know, you know". This abbreviation is used to refer to an inside joke or something that only certain people would understand. It's typically used without an explanation.

## 4\. GRWM

 GRWM means "get ready with me". The term is most popular on TikTok for videos showing creators getting ready for the day. This could be in preparation for running errands, attending an event, or going on a date.

## 5\. DM

 A DM is a direct message sent on a social media app. It's where users can communicate privately instead of publicly, like in post comments. For example, you can send a [DM on social media](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-does-dm-mean/) when you want to share someone's post with a friend privately.

## 6\. #F4F

 #F4F means "follow for follow". Users often leave this hashtag in your comments after following you. It's their way of letting you know they've just followed you and asking you to follow them back. You aren't necessarily obligated to follow them back, but you may lose them as a follower if you don't.

## 7\. #L4L

 Similar to #F4F, the #L4L hashtag stands for "like for like". People leave this hashtag on your post when they've liked your posts and would like you to return the favor.

## 8\. RT

 On X (formerly Twitter), RT stands for retweet, which means to repost a tweet. Retweets help posts get more visibility and engagement. If you see someone's retweets so often they start annoying you, you can [turn off their retweets without unfollowing them](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/turn-off-retweets-twitter-without-unfollowing/) .

 While the terms "tweet" and "retweet" have technically been retired with X's rebranding in 2023, you'll still find people using the terms.

## 9\. ATP

 ATP means "at this point". This abbreviation shows up in social media captions and comments. It means at this moment in time. For example, "I don't know what to do about this situation ATP." It's also commonly written in lowercase letters.

## 10\. ATM

 ATM is short for "at the moment". Similar to ATP, ATM simply means right now.

## 11\. FW

 FW stands for "f\*\*\* with". If someone says they f\*\*\* with something, they mean they cosign it. Conversely, if they say they don't FW with something, it means they don't associate with it.

## 12\. IKTR

 IKTR means "I know that's right". This term is used when you agree with something or can relate to the situation. For example, someone may post that doing their nails is a form of self-care. Another user may comment "IKTR".

## 13\. ICYMI

 Popular on X, ICYMI stands for "in case you missed it". It's used to bring your audience up to speed about something that happened while they were away or that they missed on their timeline.

## 14\. IJS

 IJS means "I'm just saying". The IJS abbreviation is often added to the end of a post about an unpopular opinion or differing view.

## 15\. IMO/IMHO

 IMO and IMHO stand for "in my opinion" and "in my honest opinion", respectively. These abbreviations are used when someone expresses their opinion on social media. People may feel the need to add it as a disclaimer when they anticipate that other users may disagree with them.

## 16\. OOMF

 OOMF means "one of my followers". You'll most likely see this abbreviation on X. It's used when a user refers to someone who follows them but doesn't want to reveal their name or handle.

## 17\. TBH/TBQH

 TBH and TBQH stand for "to be honest" and "to be quite hones"t, respectively. These informal abbreviations are used in different contexts, including opinions, hot takes, and admissions.

## 18\. FRFR

## 19\. BFFR

 BFFR is short for "be for f\*\*\*ing real". BFFR is used when you disagree with someone or an idea and want it to be known that it's either ridiculous, naive, or dumb.

## 20\. WCW

 WCW stands for "Woman Crush Wednesday". WCW is used on posts that celebrate women on Wednesdays. Users may post one or more women and may or may not explain why they've picked them as their WCW. The abbreviation can also be used as a hashtag.

## 21\. MCM

 MCM is short for "Man Crush Monday". This is similar to WCW but for men. And instead of Wednesdays, the posts are uploaded on Mondays.

## 22\. TBT

 TBT means "Throwback Thursday". Thursdays are for walking down memory lane on social media. TBT is used with an old picture you're posting or reposting, and can be used as a hashtag.​​​​​​​

## 23\. FBF

 FBF stands for "Flashback Friday". Just like TBT, social media users post memories or repost posts with the abbreviation FBF or the hashtag #FBF on Fridays.​​​​​​​

## 24\. OOTD

 OOTD is short for "outfit of the day". Popular on Instagram and TikTok, OOTD is used to show off your outfit for that particular day.

## 25\. OOTN

 OOTN means "outfit of the night". Like OOTD, OOTN is used to show off one's outfit for the night.​​​​​​​

## 26\. HT

## 28\. PM

## 30\. FOMO

The feeling is often triggered by what you see others talking about online. Fortunately, there are [ways to prevent FOMO when using social media](https://www.makeuseof.com/ways-to-prevent-fomo-social-media/) .
