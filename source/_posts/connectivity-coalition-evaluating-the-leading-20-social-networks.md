## Connectivity Coalition: Evaluating the Leading 20 Social Networks

 Do you want to make sure you're using the best social media apps? After all, there are now so many social networks vying for your attention, that it can be difficult to choose between them all.

 To help you out, we have compiled a list of the top social media apps and sites to use in 2023.

## 1. Facebook

![Icons on Facebook's Navigation Sidebar](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/icons-on-facebook-s-navigation-sidebar.jpg)

 Let's start with the obvious choices. For all its faults (and there are a lot of them), Facebook is still comfortably the most popular social network in the world.

 With more than 2.95 billion users, it's the place to go if you want to easily connect with most of the people from your current or former life. Facebook Marketplace has also become one of the most popular ways to buy and sell items locally and is now more popular than Craigslist.

## 2. Instagram

 If you enjoy exploring captivating images and short, snappy video clips, then Instagram is undoubtedly the ideal social network for you. Surprisingly, a whopping 57% of Americans between the ages of 25 and 30 have an account on Instagram.

 Perhaps unfairly, the network has developed a reputation for being superficial and full of selfies. If you dig past the junk, you can find stunning photography, incredible artwork, and plenty more. Instagram also has Reels, which are videos produced by Instagram users in a video feed.

## 3. X

 X is another network that's received a considerable amount of negative coverage. However, if you want breaking news, instant reactions, and access to your favorite sports stars, celebrities, and journalists, X is an unrivaled resource.

 You can even save videos from X (if you find some good ones!). This platform has also increased its character limit to 25,000 for X Premium subscribers.

## 4. LinkedIn

![A comment on a LinkedIn post on the web app](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/linkedin-comment-web.jpg)

 LinkedIn provides social networking for professionals. As the site has grown, it's become one of the best ways to build your CV, find a new job, and network within your professional circles. If you want to boost your visibility further and make use of some advanced LinkedIn features, you have the option to subscribe to LinkedIn Premium as well.

 The platform also has[LinkedIn Learning courses for professional development](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-linkedin-learning-courses-professional-development/) , which can help you enhance your career.

## 5. Snapchat

 Snapchat is almost exclusively a young person's hangout. The site revolves around sharing self-destructing images and videos, though there's also a messaging tool and lots of gamification features.

 You can use the different types of filters available and even[make your own Snapchat filter](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/make-snapchat-filter/) if you are feeling creative!

## 6. Tumblr

![tumblr forums home screen](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/tumblr-1.jpg)

 Tumblr is what happens when the worlds of social networking and blogging collide. You can post text, photos, videos, and other media content onto your blog page, which other users can then follow.

 The network also supports HTML editing; if you're skilled enough, you can completely customize the look and layout of your page. You can even use a custom domain name.

## 7. Pinterest

![Search results on Pinterest for Copenhagen photographers](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/finding-local-photographers-on-pinterest.jpeg)

 Pinterest is another of the best social media apps. It is best described as an image bookmarking site (though it also supports GIFs and videos). You can add images to your public or private boards, follow other users and boards, and comment on pins.

 The site is excellent if you're looking for inspiration for a DIY project, or you need something to spark a creative idea in your head.

## 8. Sina Weibo

![Sina Weibo homepage](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sina-weibo-homepage.jpg)

 Sina Weibo is China's answer to Twitter. With more than 593 million users, it is one of the most popular social networks in the world.

 The Chinese government heavily censors the site, but if you want to keep your finger on the pulse of what's happening in Asia, it is worth signing up.

## 9. Reddit

![A Reddit post on the desktop version](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/reddit-protest-post.jpg)

 Billed as the front page of the internet, Reddit is part discussion forum, part content submission site. Users can upvote and downvote posts to help influence what is popular at any given moment.

 The site is divided into subreddits. They cover almost every subject matter you can think of. If you have a niche hobby, Reddit is a great place to find like-minded people.

## 10. TikTok

![TikTok account](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/tiktok-account.jpg)

 Compared to older apps like Twitter and Facebook, TikTok is a fresh-faced social media app. It was created to fill the space that Vine left behind after its shutdown, but it has long since superseded it.

 There's clearly significant demand for short-form video; TikTok is one of the most downloaded apps in both the App Store and Google Play Store. While it's a fun app, there are some[TikTok security risks to be aware of](https://www.makeuseof.com/is-tiktok-dangerous/) .

## 11. Ask.fm

![Ask.fm homepage](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/askfm-homepage.jpg)

 The next entry on our list of social media apps is Ask.fm. It's a question-and-answer site where users submit queries. Anyone can jump in and offer their thoughts.

 The site used to be anonymous, but the suicides of two British teenagers, after they were allegedly cyberbullied, forced a much-needed rethink. Today, Ask.fm is one of the[sites that parents should add to their block list](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/sites-parents-add-block-list/) .

## 12. Threads

![screenshot of threads app search page](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/threads-search-1.jpg)

Close

 In July 2023, there was a big buzz as Meta unveiled its exciting new social media platform, Threads. Since its launch, Threads has experienced unprecedented growth, becoming the fastest-growing platform in the history of social media, boasting over 100 million accounts one week after launch.

 Threads operates in a similar fashion to X, which means you can create and share threads consisting of text, links, photos, or any combination of these elements. Furthermore, you can engage with others by replying to posts and reacting to content, just like you would on Instagram. You can easily access Threads using your existing Instagram account.

## 13. Flickr

![Flickr Signup page](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/flickr-signup-page.jpg)

 Flickr is primarily a photo-hosting site. There are free and paid options. The free option used to provide 1TB of space, but at the start of 2019, the company reduced it to 1,000 images.

 Users can comment, share, and like photos that they appreciate. Flickr also announced that only 50 photos will be able to be marked non-public, so almost all photos you upload will be able to be viewed by anyone. Our[guide on Flickr for beginners](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-flickr-guide-photo-sharing/) can help you make the best use of this platform.

## 14. Meetup

![Groups on the Meetup website](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/groups-in-meetup.jpg)

 Meetup straddles the divide between an online social network and a real-life social network. You can use the online tools to find groups and events that match your interests, then turn up to the group's next meetup.

 If you live in a big city, the available meetups can be as diverse as sports teams to language learning groups. In more rural areas, the choices can be more limited.

## 15. InterNations

![Internations homepage](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/internations.jpg)

 If you're an expat, you should have an account on InterNations. The site lets you find other people in your city who match your language, interests, or line of work.

 Like Meetup, there are plenty of physical events you can attend. Alternatively, you can just use the site to ask questions and gain insights about your adopted home. It is, however, essential to note that the free plan doesn't let you do much so if you plan to make full use of the platform, you will have to upgrade to their Albatross plan.

## 16. XING

![Xing job search](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/xing-job-search.jpg)

 XING is a popular alternative to LinkedIn in mainland Europe. The site offers profiles, groups, events, discussion forums, and community features.

 If you want to use the advanced search feature, you will need to pay a monthly fee.

## 17. Nextdoor

 Nextdoor is a neighborhood-based social network. It has strict privacy controls, meaning only people who live in your area can join your neighborhood's specific group.

 If you're looking for a way to manage neighborhood watch schemes, organize local bring-and-buys, or just keep everyone abreast of the local community's news. However, some are concerned that[Nextdoor might be a security risk](https://www.makeuseof.com/is-nextdoor-safe-or-a-security-risk/) .

## 18. YouTube

![youtube homepage](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/youtube-homepage.jpg)

 YouTube is the go-to platform for video content, with something for everyone. Whether you're into learning new things, watching entertainment, checking out product reviews, or just following someone's daily life through vlogs, YouTube has got you covered.

 It is also known as the second-largest search engine on the internet after Google and provides you content suggestions based on your viewing history and preferences, providing a personalized viewing experience.

## 19. Foursquare City Guide

![Foursquare map](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/foursquare-map.jpg)

 Foursquare City Guide is a location-based social media app. You can use it to find places of interest, restaurants, events, and other nearby locations when you're out and about.

 Of course, the location-based aspect means the app faces lots of privacy questions, which means it might not be right for you.

## 20. Myspace

 Yes, Myspace is still alive. Today, it's a music-themed social network. In many ways, it's filled the void left by Spotify after the Swedish company stripped away the app's best social features.

 Myspace lets you both listen to music and chat about it with other users. There is also a stream of news and opinion articles about the wider industry. This platform, however, no longer supports its Android or iPhone apps.

## Even More Social Networks to Explore

 There are so many social media platforms in the world that this list has barely scratched the surface. If you do a bit of digging, you'll be able to find a social media app dedicated to whatever niches interest you.

 Before you jump into social media, just remember to stay alert for scams, trolls, and other undesirable content. It can be a force for harm as much as a force for good.
