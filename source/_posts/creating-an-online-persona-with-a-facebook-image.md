## Creating an Online Persona with a Facebook Image

 In your Facebook feed, you've probably seen your friends and family posting cartoon-style emojis. If you haven't yet done so, you can also create a similar personalized avatar of your own.

 You can use avatars in your profile picture, along with in various other ways on the platform. In this article, you'll find out how to create a Facebook avatar and share it with others.

## What Are Facebook Avatars?

 The Facebook avatar is a lookalike of a person with more of a fun touch. Using different faces and hairstyles, you can customize them however you like. Once created, avatars also can be used as stickers to display emotions that you would otherwise typically express through emojis.

 You can share Facebook avatars regardless of whether you use the platform on your computer, tablet, or smartphone.

### Why Did Facebook Add Avatars?

 With the purchase of Bitmoji in 2016, Snapchat enabled users to create their own virtual characters.

 As a way to challenge Snapchat, Facebook introduced a similar feature—called Avatars—in 2019\. Having started off in Australia, Avatars has since out elsewhere on the planet.

 Now that you know a little about what a Facebook avatar is, you can find out how to make and share your own below.

## How to Create a Facebook Avatar

 To begin creating your own avatar on Facebook, you'll first need to log into Facebook on your smartphone. Click on**the three dots** in the top right-hand corner to open**Menu** , or swipe right a few times to achieve the same end result.
