## Creating Engaging Translated Content for Social Networking Sites

 Social media has revolutionized the way people communicate with one another. Facebook is a social networking website where millions of people come together every day to share updates, photos, reels, and more.

 Facebook is especially popular among young adults and businesses use it as a promotional tool to reach out to their customers. Pages can post language-specific content on Facebook to target foreign audiences interested in certain topics such as fashion, shopping, travel, and food.

 Let's take a look at how you can post in multiple languages on Facebook.

## Why Post in Multiple Languages?

 There are a lot of people who will find this option very useful. The first and most obvious use case for multilingual Facebook posts is businesses that have customers and partners all over the world—the kinds of companies that know that they have first-language speakers of many languages seeing their posts every day.

 Instead of relying on Facebook to translate or worse, not translating at all, these companies can now just include multiple languages in the same post.

 Many international companies also run several Facebook pages that communicate in different languages—this could potentially help those companies consolidate at least some of their Facebook properties, making management of their social media marketing campaigns that much simpler.

 But it's not just these massive multinationals that will benefit. Accurate and effective communication is crucial in establishing a successful Facebook presence, and not having to worry about weird Facebook translations will help a lot of companies around the world.

 Individuals, too, can take advantage of this new possibility—expatriates living in countries that speak a language other than their first will be able to better communicate with all of their contacts, no matter which language they speak. Unfortunately, the multilingual posts option is only accessible via account settings.

## How to Make Multilingual Posts on Facebook Using the Post Editor

 To get started posting to Facebook in multiple languages, you'll need to enable multilingual posts in your account settings first. Here's how to do this:

1. On your Facebook page, go to**Settings > Account settings > General.**
2. Tap**Language and Region > Multilingual posts.**
3. Click**Edit** , and select**On** to enable the feature.  
![Language and region settings in Facebook for multilingual posts](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/screenshot-2023-01-14-13-41-17-1.jpg)
4. Tap**Save Changes.** That's all there is to it!

 You may choose to write a Facebook post in a different language using its post composer. However, this option can be seen in the mobile version only. You can choose the language of your choice from the options available. Tap the**alphabet icon** to start translating or directly posting in the said language.

 You could rely on Facebook's built-in translation feature to communicate with those people, but as with any [online translation service](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/forget-google-translate-3-ways-get-accurate-quick-translation/) , you're not going to get great results all of the time.

## How to Create a Facebook Post From Your Page in Multiple Languages

 If you have a Facebook Page, you can post to your audience in multiple languages using the platform's built-in publishing tools. However, you'll need to be an admin of the Page you're posting to.

 Post its transition to Meta, Facebook has implemented a lot of changes to its functionality. You can take advantage of the [Global Pages](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/905034079579176) feature to create new**Market Pages** for your target audiences in different languages. However, do keep in mind that the feature is limited to select geographies at the moment.

 Now that you've enabled multilingual posting in the settings, you'll see a new option in the Page's post composer tool. Here's how to access the feature:

1. On your Facebook profile, select the Page you wish to post to. Switch to your Page profile.
2. Select**Meta Business Suite** . In the left menu, select**All tools** .
3. This will bring up a wider range of marketing and business tools available to you, depending on your region.
4. You'll need to select**Ads Manager** . Your page's Business Manager panel will show up.  
![Facebook Ads manager tool](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/screenshot-2023-01-14-10-36-39-1.png)
5. Hit the**three-line** menu panel on the left menu to bring up another sub-menu. Scroll down to**Page posts** under the**Engage customers** section.

6. You'll get a history of the posts published so far. Make sure you have selected the proper page, or you can change the option from the drop-down menu.
7. Tap Create post. You'll see the options to**Write in another language** .

 Want to add a third language? Click**Write post in another language** again. You can do this for many languages (I haven't been able to find a limit; it's possible that there isn't one).

 Now, when someone sees your post, they'll be given the option to select a dropdown menu and view the post in any language that you've made available.

## How to Post on Facebook Using the Multilingual Keyboard on Your Phone

 This is always a useful workaround. You can always use your phone's built-in multilingual keyboard or GBoard or other [Android keyboard apps](https://www.makeuseof.com/android-apps-keyboard-themes-change-fonts/) to type out your message in different languages. We used this on a Samsung Galaxy device. Here's how to access the feature:

1. On your desktop device, open Facebook and go to the post composer.
2. You'll see an input panel come up—emoji, text, multilingual keyboard, and other options.
3. Enter the input and output language of your choice, and type your words or phrases in the textbox.
4. The translated text will appear in the post editor. Complete your post, add your images, and click**Save** .

## Simplifying Your Social Media Presence

 The option to post a single update in multiple languages will help a lot of companies and individuals around the world simplify their social media process as well as make it more effective. The more people you can communicate with, the better! And using someone's first language is sure to earn you some appreciation.

 Of course, you'll have to make sure that you're using good translations—don't rely on an online translation service (even Google Translate). Make sure a native or near-native speaker is helping you out with your translations to make sure you benefit from this feature or find a freelance translator to do it for you.
