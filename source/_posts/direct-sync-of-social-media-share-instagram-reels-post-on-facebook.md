## Direct Sync of Social Media: Share Instagram Reels, Post on Facebook

 Have you ever wanted to share an Instagram Reel with your Facebook friends and followers? Good news! You can do this, and it's relatively simple. For those seeking to boost exposure or ensure family members see their content, sharing Reels from Instagram to Facebook is a fantastic option.

 Let's explore how you can share Instagram Reels to Facebook both before and after posting. But first, you'll need to link your Facebook and Instagram accounts.

## How to Link Facebook and Instagram

 Sharing your Instagram Reels on Facebook is an excellent way to leverage both platforms' audiences, especially since Instagram's Reels feature has become so vital. Meta has also introduced the option to [create Reels on Facebook](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-create-reels-facebook/) .

 However, you may prefer to share your current or future Instagram content as Reels on Facebook, rather than navigating the new creation tools and starting from scratch on the platform.

 You'll need to ensure that your Facebook is linked to your Instagram.[The Account Center is a hub introduced by Meta](http://www.makeuseof.com/facebook-instagram-account-center-linked-accounts/) to enhance the integration between Facebook and Instagram.

To link your accounts, follow these steps:

 5. Select the account you would like to tap**Continue** .

 6\. Choose**Yes, finish adding** .

 You will see both accounts listed under**Profiles** indicating that they have been connected.

## How to Share an Instagram Reel Before Posting

 You may choose to share your Reel prior to posting it, and there are two methods to achieve this. The first method gives you the choice of sharing to Facebook before uploading each Reel. The second method will automatically upload your Reels to Facebook, each time you post.

 To share a specific Reel to Facebook before posting, follow these steps:
