## Directive Mechanisms for Leading Facebook Group Discussions

 Facebook groups help build communities and gather people with the same interests. However, it is uncertain whether the people who join your group will have the same attitude towards its content and the group members.

 For that, Facebook allows group admins to include specific rules and policies that the members must follow. Whether it's prevention against spam or you want to establish guidelines on what to post, these rules will make your Facebook group a safe space for everyone. Here's how to add and modify these rules on your Facebook group.

## Why Are Facebook Group Rules So Important?

 Since we are unsure how someone will react, the best way to build a better community is by adding Facebook group rules. You can give the members an understanding of what is tolerable and what isn't, and if they go against the guidelines, they can be removed from the group.

 Users can usually get confused about what to post on a Facebook group. Giving them a guideline on what type of posts are acceptable in your group keeps it running and relevant at the same time. Similarly, admins can add a list of relevant topics for better guidance of the group members.

 Being members of an online community, it is likely that group members will sometimes have differences.

## How to Add Facebook Group Rules

 Once you have determined whether to have a[closed or open Facebook group](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/facebook-closed-secret-groups/) , add some necessary rules to give the community a sense of understanding about your preferences. You can add up to 10 rules for your Facebook group.

Here are the steps to add your Facebook group guidelines:

1. Open Facebook on your desktop and click**Groups** .
2. Choose the group you own and wish to change the rules of. You can find them under the**Groups You Manage** section.

## Effective Rules You Should Have for Your Facebook Group

 Not all Facebook groups are the same, but there are some general rules and guidelines that you can follow to make your community safe, accessible, and relevant for everyone who joins your group.

 Here are the most effective rules you should implement in your Facebook group:

* No spam policy: Post a rule for no spam or marketing in your group. Keep an eye on the posts and only approve those that are relevant to your Facebook group. Remember, you can only[make your Facebook group popular](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/facebook-group-popular-weekly-facebook-tips/) by posting things that matter.
* Avoid hate speech and bullying: Group members should have no right to criticize anyone based on ethnicity, religion, or region. Make sure that everyone has a calm conversation and expresses their opinions politely.
* Post relevant content: Your group is about a specific theme. People need to post things relevant to that. Make sure only to approve posts that make a difference and are meaningful.

## Create Facebook Group Rules for a Convenient and Safe Experience

 Facebook has improved its group privacy management over the past couple of years. Group admins now have the option to add and modify rules of their choice to build a safe and convenient social media society for everyone.

 You can add rules like respecting the privacy of other users, telling members what type of posts are acceptable, and avoiding spam and bullying. There are some pre-made group rules you can use as well, but it is up to you whether you want to create the Facebook group rules from scratch or not.
