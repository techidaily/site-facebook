## Discovering Hidden Gems in Your Facebook Archive

 People have always admired and cherished the concept of memories. From verbal retellings to books and photos, we have come a long way.

 Facebook also has a feature known as On This Day that takes you back to your good old memories. But is this feature just for viewing your memories on Facebook, or is there more to it?

 We have curated a guide on effectively using the On This Day feature on Facebook.

## What Is the On This Day Feature on Facebook?

 If you are keen on saving and revisiting memories, the On This Day feature is just for you. It allows you to check out the posts you made on the same day years ago—some even call it a way to relive your past cringe. It includes everything from the media you uploaded to the posts you shared and the statuses you posted.

 You can also find tagged posts, things your friends shared on your timeline, or how many years you have been friends with a user. The memories are initially shown to you privately, and you can later share and edit them.

## How to Use the On This Day Feature

 Users can access the On This Day feature on Facebook by the following method.

1. Open**Facebook** .
2. Select the**Menu** by tapping the three lines in the bottom right corner of the page.
3. Scroll down until you see**Memories** . Open it to view your activity on the same date previously.

 You can use the On This Day feature to better manage your Facebook profile. Let's see how you can share, save and manage your memories.

### 1\. Share Memories

 The first thing that most users discover is the option to share their memories with others. You can post it on your timeline, send them in messages, and even tag specific people.
