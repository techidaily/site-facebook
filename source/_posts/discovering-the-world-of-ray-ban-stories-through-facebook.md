## Discovering the World of Ray-Ban Stories Through Facebook

 Given how much the smartphone has proliferated our personal and business life, it can be hard to imagine getting things done without one. However, Facebook plans to make smartphones a thing of the past with new smart glasses designed by Ray-Ban, called the Ray-Ban Stories.

 So, what does the social media giant have up its sleeves (or rather, resting on its nose)? Let's find out.

## What Are Ray-Ban Stories?

 Ray-Ban released the above trailer to show off the new Ray-Ban Stories. These glasses were the result of the luxury sunglasses company teaming up with the tech giant Facebook. The idea behind the Ray-Ban Stories is that they can help you capture events going on around you without needing to reach for your phone.

 The glasses are equipped with cameras on the sides so you can capture everything going on from a first-person perspective. You can use them to take photos or record short videos to post later when you’re back home.

 Not only that, but the smart glasses want you to use them like you would a phone. You can use the glasses to play music and podcasts while you travel, and you can even take phone calls with them.

 The big theme around the Ray-Ban Stories is giving you the ability to capture the world around you without needing to leave it. There’s no need to scramble for your phone when something amazing happens, nor do you need to stare through a screen when recording something. Now you can capture anything just by looking at it, so you can concentrate on living in the moment.

## The Ray-Ban Stories Specifications

 The Ray-Ban Stories captures the world around you using two 5-megapixel cameras. You activate them by pressing a small button on the side of the glasses frame: a brief tap to record video and a long press for a photo. If you’re feeling brave, you can also say, “Hey Facebook, take a video” to start the process, but be prepared to record nothing but people staring at you in confusion.

 If you want to listen to music or make calls while on the go, there are miniature speakers on the frame near your ears. Facebook didn’t explain if they used any technologies to stop the people next to you on the train from hearing your podcasts but they did mention that they are “discreet.”

 The glasses have enough storage to hold 30 videos or 500 photos. Once you’re full up, you can download the media to your phone using a “Facebook View companion app.” The announcement didn’t reveal if you have to use this app or if third-party apps will also work with it.

 Fortunately, Facebook will allow you to share the media on other platforms. The video revealed that you could upload your media to WhatsApp and Snapchat, and there’s a chance that other social media platforms will also work with the glasses.

 Even if they don’t, the video states you can save the media to your phone. This implies nothing is stopping you from uploading your files wherever you like.

 The glasses will have an off switch, which will disable all the tech on them once flipped. And Facebook is proud to show off a light-up LED on the camera to show others that you’re recording them, which helps improve privacy. In the video, Mark Zuckerberg claims this is “more than what smartphones do,” but we’d argue that holding up a phone to record someone is more obvious than an LED.

## How Much Are the Ray-Ban Stories?

 If you want a pair of glasses for yourself, they won't break the bank too much. You can pick them up for $299, which is a pretty reasonable price for what you're getting.

## When Will the Ray-Ban Stories Come Out?

 The best bit is, if you're dying to wear a piece of the future, you can buy them right away. Just head over to the [Ray-Ban Stories store page](https://www.ray-ban.com/usa/electronics/RW4002%20UNISEX%20ray-ban%20stories%20%7C%20wayfarer-shiny%20black/8056597489478) and pick up a pair today.

## A New Chapter in the Story of Smart Glasses

 If you love capturing those precious moments, but you'd rather not experience it through a phone screen, the Ray-Ban Stories may just be up your alley. They're out now, so be sure to grab a pair ASAP if this sounds like something you want.
