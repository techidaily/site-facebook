## Discreet Discussions: Group Chat Hacking

 Do you have something you'd like to share with your members of a Facebook group you’re in, but you’re worried it would draw undue attention to you? Worry no more. Facebook has a feature that allows users to post anonymous posts on groups where it is enabled.

 Here’s all you need to know about anonymous posting, along with a walkthrough for using it in a Facebook group.

## A Brief Background on Anonymous Group Posts

 In June 2020, [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/community/whats-new/new-parenting-group-type/) announced the introduction of a new group type for parents in its community. It came with some features, one of which was the ability to share anonymous group posts.

 Though originally meant for parenting groups, other groups where people share sensitive information have also found this feature to be useful and thus have activated it on their group.

 To post anonymously in a Facebook group, the process is simple. All you need to do is follow the instructions below.

1. Log into your Facebook account.
2. Navigate to the group you’d like to post on.
3. Tap on**Anonymous Post** , which is near where you’d create a post.
4. A prompt explaining how anonymous posts work will pop up. Tap**Create Anonymous Post** .
5. Create your post and tap**Submit** .

 And there you have it. Now you no longer have to [leave a Facebook group](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-leave-a-facebook-group/) because you feel uncomfortable sharing your experience.

**Note:** This feature is only available in groups set as parenting groups.

## What You Need to Know About Anonymous Posts

 All anonymous posts are subject to approval by admins, even if post approval is turned off on the group. This is understandable, as it helps keep spammers at bay.

 If you post anonymously, your name will still be visible to the group’s admins and moderators. Facebook will be able to see your identity in order to enforce its Community Standards.

 Some post formats are disabled for anonymous posts to protect you from accidentally exposing your identity. You can’t go live or tag people in the Anonymous Post interface.

## Now You Know How to Share an Anonymous Post on Facebook

 Posting anonymously in a Facebook group is an effective way to share information and express opinions, without revealing your identity to group members.

 For example, if you're posting about sensitive personal topics that may be unpopular with the other members of the group, anonymity can protect you from harassment.

 You can think of it as an effective way to get your voice heard, but without the pressure of being seen.
