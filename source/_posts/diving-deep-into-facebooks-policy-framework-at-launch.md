## Diving Deep Into Facebook's Policy Framework at Launch

 Facebook isn't necessarily known for being the most transparent of brands, but it seems that it wants to change this. The company has launched a new online Transparency Center to provide more insight on its policies.

## Facebook Launches a Transparency Center to Explain Policies

 Facebook has launched an online Transparency Center to explain a little more about its policies. The company has a bit of a reputation for not always being too transparent, so this new addition is set to change that.

 Facebook announced it would release the Transparency Center back in February 2021.

 Now, as mentioned in a post on[About Facebook](https://about.fb.com/news/2021/05/scraping-by-the-numbers/) , the company has indeed launched the new Transparency Center. The Center will provide information on what Facebook's policies are, and how they're developed, updated, and enforced.

 Anybody looking to visit the new[Transparency Center](https://transparency.fb.com) can do so from Facebook's dedicated website.

 In addition to information on its policies and how it enforces them, Facebook also explains how it will combat misinformation on elections, and what the Oversight board is. Visitors will also have easy access to Facebook's transparency reports that it usually publishes.

 A spokesperson for Facebook said "Weâ€™ll continue to add more information and build out the Transparency Center as our integrity efforts continue to evolve". From this, it seems clear that Facebook is taking the Center seriously and will continue to update it over time.

## Facebook's New Focus on Transparency

 With the release of the Transparency Center, it appears that Facebook has a new focus on transparency and is taking it seriously.

 The Center doesn't give too much away too much information regarding privacy and data, which is what many users will likely look for. But it's great to see this new approach from the company.
