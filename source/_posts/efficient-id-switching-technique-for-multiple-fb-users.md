3. Click on one of your previously logged-into accounts or select**Log into another account** .
4. If logging into another account, enter your username and password and click**Log in** . If you previously checked**Remember password** , you won't receive a prompt to enter your password when switching accounts. If you haven't checked**Remember password** , you'll receive a prompt to enter the password for your account.
5. Now when you click on the Switch Accounts button, you should see both accounts. On New Facebook, you'll know which account you're currently logged into via a blue dot indicator under**Profiles** .
