## Embrace a Different Hue: Switching Facebook Themes

 If you’re not familiar with Dark Mode on Facebook, we’re here to introduce you to this useful setting. When you choose Dark Mode, the colors on your app flip. The white background becomes black, and the black text becomes white.

 The Dark Mode feature is not exclusive to Facebook. It also exists on other apps that Facebook owns, like Instagram and Whatsapp.

 The feature is available a variety of other apps, too, such as Twitter and YouTube.

 However, in this guide, we’ll explain how to switch to Dark Mode specifically on Facebook.

## Why You Should Use Dark Mode on Facebook

 There are a number of reasons you may want to switch to Dark Mode on Facebook. The most important one is to preserve battery life on your phone. When you use Dark Mode, a smaller portion of your screen is lit up, which means it uses less energy.

 If you decide to switch Facebook to Dark Mode, as well as other apps on your phone, you can help it run for longer.

 Another reason to change this setting is to help you sleep better. Some people believe that Dark Mode produces less blue light, and blue light is proven to disrupt sleep.

 However, there are no studies that suggest Dark Mode is better than simply not using the phone before you go to sleep. But if you use your phone in bed, and you share your bed with a partner, it can definitely improve their sleep as the light will be less glaring.

 Dark Mode is also useful if you don’t want to be the center of attention when you use your phone in a dark public setting, such as a theatre or lecture hall. It will keep the phone from lighting up your face.

2. Tap the**three horizontal lines** on the top right-hand side of the screen. This will lead you to the general menu.
3. Scroll down until you see**Settings & Privacy** . Tap the arrow on the right to open this menu.
4. **Dark Mode** should appear right under**Your Time On Facebook** . If you can’t see that option, make sure you have installed the latest Facebook update, as well as the latest OS.
5. Tap**Dark Mode** and select one of the options.**On** will keep your app dark all the time,**Off** will make it light again, and**System** will adjust the appearance according to your phone’s settings.

 Some newer phones enable Dark Mode on all apps according to a schedule, which is where the**System** option comes in handy. For instance, you can choose to have Dark Mode on everything after 9pm.

## More Ways to Save Battery Life

 Dark Mode is one of the most common ways to squeeze a little more out of your battery. However, it is not the only thing you could try if you want your phone to last for longer periods of time.

 You can adjust the lock screen time, disable push notifications, lower your brightness, and more.

 Switching between light and dark on Facebook is easy, so give both a try and see which you like best.
