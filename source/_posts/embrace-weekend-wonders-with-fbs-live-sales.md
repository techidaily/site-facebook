## Embrace Weekend Wonders with FB's Live Sales

 Facebook is expanding its online shopping options by hosting a three-month-long event called Live Shopping Fridays. The company has partnered up with some of the major makeup and clothing brands to provide its users with a new and fun curated shopping experience.

## Shoppable Live Videos From Popular Brands

 Facebook has announced the launch of Live Shopping Fridays. According to a post on the [Facebook Newsroom](https://about.fb.com/news/2021/05/introducing-your-new-favorite-way-to-shop-live-shopping-fridays/) , every Friday starting from May 21 through July 16, 2021, you'll be able to watch live videos of some of the biggest brands showcasing their products.

 During those live streams, you'll have the chance to purchase any product presented by the brand directly on the Facebook app.

 Also, it will be possible to interact with the brand by asking any questions related to its products. For example, if you'll have doubts about what lipstick shade to choose, the brand's speaker would be able to help you with that.
