## Enabling Anonymous Shares in Social Media Clans

 Facebook groups are a great way to stay connected with people from different walks of life. Group members can share ideas and opinions on matters of common interest, plus more.

 However, there are some group members who avoid sharing their experiences through group posts for fear of attracting undue attention.

 Thankfully, there’s a feature you can enable in your group to allow users to post anonymously. In this article, you'll learn how to enable this feature in your Facebook group.

## How to Enable Anonymous Posts in Your Facebook Group

 The anonymous posting feature is only available for groups set as Parenting. So, if your group is set to another group type, you’d need to change this.

 Changing your group type doesn’t affect your group in any way; it only changes the features that are available for use on it.

 Here's how to change your group type so you can post anonymously.

1. Login to your Facebook account.
2. Navigate to the group you’d like to activate it on.
3. Tap on the**shield icon** in the top right of the screen to reveal your **Admin Tools** .
4. Tap on **Group Settings** .
5. Choose **Group Type** and select**Parenting** .

 There you have it. Group members can now post without revealing their identity. All they need to do is tap on **Anonymous post** just below where they’d normally create a post.

 All anonymous posts are subject to approval from admins and moderators, even if you don’t have post approval turned on for your group. As an admin, you’ll also be able to see the identity of users who wish to post anonymously on the pending posts page.

## Why Might You Want to Enable Anonymous Posts on Facebook?

 One reason you might want to enable anonymous posts on your group is so that group members can share their experiences without revealing their identity.

 Enabling anonymous posts will encourage people who are shy or worried about expressing themselves publicly to share their thoughts with everyone else. This will increase your group engagement and reduce the chances of people[leaving the group](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-leave-a-facebook-group/) .

## Should You Enable Anonymous Posting in Your Facebook Group?

 It's a dicey decision whether to enable anonymous posting on your Facebook group. One thing is for sure, it can't hurt to try! Many people are hesitant about enabling this option because they think that anonymity will result in more rude or offensive posts.

 However, this is unlikely as all anonymous posts are subject to admin approval, where you can even see the poster’s identity. Some users will be more likely to share their experiences if they can do so anonymously, which will help to improve engagement in your group.
