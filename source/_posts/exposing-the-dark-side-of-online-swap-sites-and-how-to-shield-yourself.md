## Exposing the Dark Side of Online Swap Sites and How to Shield Yourself

 When looking to save some money, many people turn to platforms that sell secondhand items. While buying these items is a great way to save money on the products you need, you also take on additional risks that you don’t have to worry about when purchasing from large retailers.

 Potential scams are a problem that deters people from using services offered by such sites—false advertising? Fake buyers? Facebook Marketplace may leave you vulnerable to both, and more.

## What Is Facebook Marketplace?

 Founded in 2016, Facebook Marketplace is a service built into the popular social media site. It allows Facebook users to post (or purchase) virtually any item for sale. Users may post everything from clothes and furniture to pet supplies and electronics. There is even a section for people to [post “free items” they want to give away, much like Craigslist](http://www.makeuseof.com/apps-like-craigslist/) .

 When used responsibly, Facebook Marketplace is an excellent resource for getting anything you need at an affordable price. Learning how to identify sketchy situations and suspicious items lets you take advantage of everything the platform has to offer while keeping yourself in the black, with all limbs intact.

 In many cases, parties meet up in person to check out the products and pay using cash or by using apps like PayPal. You can arrange for someone to ship the item, so you don’t need to meet them, which is definitely advisable when possible.

## Is Facebook Marketplace Safe to Shop At?

 Plenty of people use Facebook Marketplace successfully. It is an effective way to find local sales in your area, but not all exchanges are “safe.” Is it risky to try buying or selling on Facebook Marketplace? Scams will inevitably be much more common on platforms like these than in a traditional retail setting.

 Luckily, these risks are often easy to avoid. By learning how to identify Facebook Marketplace scams and practice online shipping and shopping safety, Facebook Marketplace is a secure resource for your second-hand shopping needs.

## Facebook Marketplace Scams to Watch Out For ![A person using a phone.](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tinder-scams-1.jpg)

 There are many Facebook Marketplace scams you may encounter. Although they vary a bit, the gist of that they all share is that users don’t deliver on the promises they advertise, or would-be buyers have other intentions in mind. These incidences may refer to times when the product is not as stated, or they plan on robbing you. Some common scams to look out for include:

### 1\. Defective Items

 It’s sometimes difficult to tell in pictures if an item is broken, especially with electronics. Some people turn to secondhand shops when they notice that their products face the end of their functioning lives.

 Although broken screens or missing buttons may jump out at a potential buyer, problems with software or slowly malfunctioning hardware may not be as apparent. Sometimes, you may not realize that an item is about to break until it’s too late to get in touch with the seller again. It’s easy for a seller to post an unwanted product and simply disappear after someone buys it.

### 2\. Bootleg Items

 Another common scam people partake in is sometimes selling bootleg or knockoff items. These Facebook Marketplace scams are common with luxury label clothes and accessories.

 If you have no experience in the matter, it’s easy to mistake a knockoff expensive Coach bag or Gucci belt for the real deal. The same goes for “real” gold or diamonds. Sometimes, the seller doesn’t even know they aren't real.

### 3\. Stolen Goods

 Even if the item fits the description, there may be sketchy situations surrounding how someone obtained the item. Selling stolen products online is a great way for thieves to get rid of items and get a quick buck.

 Just because you aren’t the one that stole it doesn’t mean you won’t end up with problems if someone identifies your item as stolen. Always ask for receipts or any other proof of authenticity if you have concerns in this area.

### 4\. Robbery

 These previous examples assume that there even is an item to be bought to begin with. Some people purposely try to post (or buy) products without ever giving anything for the transaction, openly robbing you through Facebook.

 If you're the buyer, you need to worry about paying for something you never receive. Perhaps the scammer sends you an empty box, if anything at all. Sellers are not immune from these scams, as they risk giving an item and never receiving money for it (or ending up with a bounced check).

 In some cases, after paying, people wait to receive (or pick up) the item then later report the transaction as fraud. Banks may reverse charges, leaving you with no money or commodity.

### 5\. Phishing Scams

 Sometimes, the offending party doesn’t want anything at all. Social media sites offer some scammers a [platform for phishing](https://www.makeuseof.com/most-common-social-media-phishing-attacks/) . Phishing scams involve tricking you into sharing sensitive personal information that is exploited later on.

 Buyers (or sellers) may unknowingly hand their information over to scammers. Even without exchanging any physical items or money, you might still be putting yourself at risk.

 Although some Facebook Marketplace scams are more complex than others, there are some key red flags to look out for. Following these tips is a great way to reduce the risk and keep your money (or items) safe.

### Inspect the Product

 If you can, meet in person and check out the product beforehand to verify its functionality and quality.

### Meet in Public Place

 When possible, avoid meeting at your home and find public places to meet up at a reasonable time.

### Read User Ratings

 User ratings are there for a reason, and you should take them seriously.

### Beware of Suspicious Posts

 If something is super cheap or otherwise “too good to be true,” it probably is.

### Use Trusted Payment Methods

 Using secure payment methods (like PayPal) is a great way to keep your money safe if the transaction goes wrong.

### Don’t Ship Before Payment

 PayPal warns you never to ship before payment. They can’t guarantee your money back if you send the item first.

### Keep Evidence

 Keep any records of the item you have, relevant message logs, and any receipts for shipment, just in case.

## Is Facebook Marketplace Safe to Use?

 Facebook Marketplace is a fantastic platform that has plenty of amazing things to offer users. Enjoying services does come with some risk, but many of these scams are easy to avoid.
