## Facebook's Portal Transforms with Go Adventure

 Facebook is taking its Portal line in a different direction. The social networking giant recently unveiled the new Facebook Portal Go.

 We'll take a look at the new product and how it differs from other devices in the Portal family.

## Video Chatting and More on the Go ![facebook portal go charger](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/facebook-portal-go-charger-1.jpg)

 Portal Go brings the usual smart camera experience but with a unique twist. Thanks to a built-in battery, the device can be taken from room to room in a home during a Zoom video call or anything else.

 There's even a built-in handle to help make the device easier to hold.

 The device sports a 10-inch screen and a 12-megapixel camera with an ultrawide field of view. That will help keep the person talking in view at all times.

 And even when you're not on a video call, the Portal Go has a wide variety of other features. It offers Amazon's Alexa built so you can check the weather, play a song, and more with a simple voice command.

 It's also compatible with a wide variety of other services like Pandora, Spotify, and Plex.

 For privacy, the Portal Go offers a built-in camera cover and a switch that can disable the microphone and camera.

## Pre-Order the Facebook Portal Go Now

 The Facebook Portal Go [retails for $199](https://portal.facebook.com/products/portal-go/) . You can preorder the device now directly from Facebook. Orders will start shipping on October 19.

## A New Way to Use Facebook Portal

 The new Facebook Portal Go provides a unique way to enjoy the social network's video chat-focused hardware. The built-in battery and ability to move between rooms in your house makes it stand out in a sea of other smart speakers with a touchscreen and cameras.

 And if the Portal Go doesn't pique your interest, the Portal TV lets you turn any television into a big-screen video chatting platform.
