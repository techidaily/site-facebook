## Fast-Tracking Access to Multiple User IDs in Facebook

 Whether you have multiple Facebook accounts or share a computer with friends and family, you'll need to know how to switch Facebook accounts. Thankfully, the social network makes it easy to quickly switch between profiles using the same browser.

 In this article, we'll walk you through quickly switching between your Facebook accounts so you can save time.

1. While logged into Facebook, click on the**Account** button next to**Notifications** .
2. Select**See all profiles** , then select**Switch accounts** .
3. Click on one of your previously logged-into accounts or select**Log into another account** .
4. If logging into another account, enter your username and password and click**Log in** . If you previously checked**Remember password** , you won't receive a prompt to enter your password when switching accounts. If you haven't checked**Remember password** , you'll receive a prompt to enter the password for your account.
5. Now, when you click on the Switch Accounts button, you should see both accounts. On New Facebook, you'll know which account you're currently logged into via a blue dot indicator under**Profiles** .
6. If you decide you'd like to remove an account from your computer, go to Switch Accounts, then click the**X** to the right of the account name.

 If you don't like Facebook's new look, it doesn't need to be one of your [reasons to quit Facebook for good](https://www.makeuseof.com/reasons-to-quit-facebook/) . Instead, you can restore the classic style while taking advantage of the quick account switching.

## How to Switch Between Facebook Accounts (Classic Facebook)

 While classic Facebook is no longer officially available, extensions have attempted to recreate the experience. Unfortunately, these either no longer work or provide limited functionality based on your account.

 If you're using an extension like Old Layout for Facebook for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/old-layout-for-facebook/) or [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/old-layout-for-facebook/abmkkackbbimmdbfjdilpnfaegaeagge) that runs a script to restore the classic aesthetic, you'll still follow the same steps as the current version of Facebook:

1. While logged into Facebook, click on the**Account** button next to**Notifications** .
2. Select**See all profiles** , then select**Switch accounts** .
3. Click on one of your previously logged-into accounts or select**Log into another account** .
4. If logging into another account, enter your username and password and click**Log in** . If you previously checked**Remember password** , you won't receive a prompt to enter your password when switching accounts. If you haven't checked**Remember password** , you'll receive a prompt to enter the password for your account.
5. Now when you click on the Switch Accounts button, you should see both accounts. On New Facebook, you'll know which account you're currently logged into via a blue dot indicator under**Profiles** .
6. If you decide you'd like to remove an account from your computer, go to Switch Accounts then click the**X** to the right of the account name.

 If you find yourself dissatisfied with the limited emulation of classic Facebook, there are still some things that can be done to make new Facebook better.

## How to Stay Secure When Switching Facebook Accounts

 Because you have the option to always enter your password when switching profiles, this feature is useful for family members who share a computer. Facebook also allows you to add up to 10 accounts using the Account Switcher feature.

 It will also come in handy if you have a separate Facebook login for work. That way, you can keep all things work and personal completely separated.

 While this password setting does help protect your separate accounts, it's good to be prepared. You should make sure you know the best ways to [secure your Facebook account for recovery](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/5-secure-facebook-account-recoverable/) .
