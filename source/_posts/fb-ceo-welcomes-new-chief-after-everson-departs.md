## FB CEO Welcomes New Chief After Everson Departs

 Now that Facebook is losing a big chunk of its revenue thanks to Apple's iOS 14.5 security update, its relationship with its advertisers has become even more important.

 It's somewhat unfortunate timing, but a key player in Facebook's advertising strategy has just stepped down.

## Facebook Loses Its Top Ad Executive

 Carolyn Everson, now former vice president of Facebook's Global Business Group, has [posted](https://www.facebook.com/carolyn.everson/posts/10158032648075913) to her Facebook page saying that she has left the company.

 Everson worked at Facebook for more than ten years, and thus is no doubt largely responsible for turning it into the advertising giant it is today.

 "I am extremely proud of what we set out to accomplish but way more proud of my team and the support we showed each other, especially in difficult times," Everson writes. "I am very much looking forward to starting a new chapter."

 Everson doesn't go into details as to what her plans are from here on out, but [Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/outgoing-facebook-carolyn-everson-is-believed-headed-for-a-ceo-role-2021-6) reports that she's now looking to fill a top executive role elsewhere.

 Two unnamed industry professionals believe that Everson wants to be a CEO, with one adding that an early-stage, California-based marketing and tech company is hoping to hire her.

 "Carolyn wants to be a CEO. Even if Marne \[Levine, vice president for global partnerships\] hadn't been brought in, that represents a ceiling for her there and she wants to have a new opportunity," said one of the sources.

 There's also talk of Everson working at TikTok, but [ByteDance CFO Shouzi Chew was appointed the new CEO](https://www.makeuseof.com/tiktok-ceo-bytedance-cfo/) in early May, so that seems rather unlikely. Unless, of course, she settles for another position.

 Everson's departure is the second recent change to Facebook's executive structure. In early June, Marne Levine was promoted to chief business officer (a role above Everson's former position) after David Fischer resigned.

 Prior to Facebook, Everson worked as head of ad sales at ViacomCBS' MTV Networks, then global head of advertising at Microsoft.

## What Does This Mean for Facebook?

 With this change in leadership may come a change in how Facebook deals with its advertisers. While the company surely has other qualified, long-term employees that could fill the position, it'll be hard-pressed to find someone willing to fill Everson's shoes.

 Historically speaking, the ad sales chief deals with criticism like no otherâ€”especially when the social platform is in hot water (which happens way more more often than it should). Whoever takes up the role will become the first person activists and advertisers will contact when they've got a complaint.

 It's a role with a lot of responsibilities, and thus, a lot of stress. We'll have to wait and see whether this'll cause any major changes to the company's operations.
