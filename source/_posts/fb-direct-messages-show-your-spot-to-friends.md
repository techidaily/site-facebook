 By following the above steps, you will be able to send your live location to your contact. Your location will update in real-time, so the person you've shared it with can follow your progress.

 Once you reach your destination or you want to stop sharing your live location, click on**Stop Sharing Location** .

## How to Share a Pinned Location in Facebook Messenger

 Facebook Messenger also allows you to share any other point on the map instead of your current location by pinning it.

Follow these simple instructions to send a pinned location:

1. Launch the Facebook Messenger app and open a chat with the person you want to share your location with.
2. Next, tap on the**Plus (+)** icon in the bottom-left corner.
3. Tap on the**Pin** icon on the map.

 Here, you have two ways to pin a specific location. Either manually drag the pin to your desired location and hit the**Send Location** button or enter a location in the search field and hit the**Share icon** next to it.
