## Friends Across Platforms: Embodying Your Social Media Self on WhatsApp

 With Facebook, now you can create your personalized avatars and customize them with different hairstyles, outfits, skin tones, and more. Once created, you can use it as your profile picture, share it as a sticker in the comments section of a post, and set it as the background of your post.

 You can also send them as a sticker on Facebook Messenger or share them externally outside Facebook.

 As Facebook and WhatsApp are linked together, you can share the avatar directly on WhatsApp too. This article will show you how to use your Facebook Avatar in WhatsApp messages.
