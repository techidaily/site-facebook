## Full Ban on Facebook Delivery of Notifications

 Over time, Facebook has become so engrossing that users spend hours on the app without even noticing. A simple notification from someone you know can turn into an hour-long session of browsing and scrolling.

 This has led to many people exceeding their desired screen time. Are you looking for a way to reduce the use of Facebook? If so, turning off notifications with a few simple steps can benefit you greatly.

## Benefits of Turning Off Facebook Notifications

 Facebook is one of the[top social media apps](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/top-social-media-apps-sites/) out there, but people often want to turn off their notifications. Some benefits of blocking all Facebook notifications are as follows...

### Less Stress

 Work, family time, and financial responsibilities can get so tiresome that people need some time away from everything. In such a scenario, a simple notification with some news or message can ruin your mood.

 That’s why people should turn off their notifications every couple of days to give themselves time to relax and refresh for the coming days. Releasing stress away from the screen can have a number of mental health and productivity benefits.

### Better Concentration

 Let’s face it—we run to grab our mobile phone the second its screen brightens for a notification. This can be really distracting if you’re trying to work or study.

 By stopping Facebook notifications on your mobile and desktop, it is possible to concentrate on the task at hand.

### Healthy Lifestyle

 Addiction to social media apps can lead to a sedentary lifestyle and lack of activity. Instead of spending time clicking every notification you receive on Facebook, we recommend going out to grab some fresh air and refrain from using the phone.

### More Confidence

 Avoiding social media can improve your confidence if you're prone to[social media comparison](https://www.makeuseof.com/social-media-making-you-sad-scientific-studies/) . You get time to focus on yourself, elevate your confidence level and encourage yourself to embrace rather than fall victim to a comparison trap.
