## Guidelines for Managing Linked Apps & Sites to FB

 Facebook makes it quicker and easier to sign in to apps and websites as you typically don’t have to go through a lengthy sign-in process, simply using your Facebook profile.

 Even though this feature is convenient, you might want to remove some of the apps connected to your Facebook, or simply manage the permissions. Fortunately, you can do just that from your Facebook settings.

1. Log onto **[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/)**  .
2. Click on your profile icon in the top-right corner.
