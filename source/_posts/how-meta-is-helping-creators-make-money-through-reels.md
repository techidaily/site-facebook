## How Meta Is Helping Creators Make Money Through Reels

 Social media has enormous earning potential and can be a lucrative income stream for creators.

 As for Reels, they've taken off since Meta launched them as its TikTok rival. Due to their popularity, Meta has been helping creators monetize on Reels.

 Now, Meta is improving how it helps creators get paid through Reels. Today, we will cover the various ways in which the tech giant is helping its creators make money through Reels.

 Meta is paying creators for Reels, improving how it pays them, and providing them with insights to better understand how their Reels perform.

 The announcement came in the form of a[Meta blog post](https://web.facebook.com/creators/reels-content-monetization-updates?%5Frdc=1&%5Frdr) on May 4, 2022\. It read:

> Weâ€™re making a few changes to our incentives program that give creators ways to reach new followers and uncover new opportunities.

 This might form part of Meta's plan to give TikTok a run for its money. TikTok found success in short-form video content and its powerful algorithm, which makes videos go viral. In April 2022, Instagram Head Adam Mosseri announced that the company would[prioritize original content](https://www.makeuseof.com/instagram-rewarding-original-content/) in its algorithms.

 Now, Meta is paying creators for it. By incentivizing creators to publish original content consistently in the form of Reels, Meta may be positioning itself to[better compete with TikTok](https://www.makeuseof.com/can-reels-solve-the-tiktok-problem-for-facebook/) . And so far, Reels are doing well on Instagram.

 In fact, statistics show that people are spending more time watching short-form video content on Instagram than on TikTok. According to[Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1237210/average-time-spent-per-session-on-short-form-video-platforms-worldwide/) , users spend an estimated 53 minutes per session on Instagram, with TikTok trailing closely behind with 45 minutes per session.

 And in its Q1 2022 earnings call, Meta revealed that users spend 20% of their time on Reels on Instagram and 50% of their time on videos on Facebook. That proves that there are earning opportunities for creators in Reels.
