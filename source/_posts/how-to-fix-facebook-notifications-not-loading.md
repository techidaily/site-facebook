## How to Fix Facebook Notifications Not Loading

 Have your Facebook app notifications stopped working? If so, it's extremely frustrating as you won't know what's going on with your friends on the platform. There are many reasons the Facebook app for iPhone and Android won't deliver your notifications. You can tweak a few options here and there on your phone and in the app to get your Facebook notifications back.

 Here are various solutions to fix your Facebook notifications not working on Android and iOS.

## 1\. Check Your Internet Connection

 The first reason why you might not receive Facebook notifications is a poor internet connection. Maybe you are out of range of your Wi-Fi signal or the internet is down.

 Open**Settings** on your smartphone and go to**Wi-Fi** . Choose a network that you usually connect to. Once connected, a blue tick will appear next to the name. If the internet isn't working, you can see**No Network Available** . On Android, open**Settings** and search for**Wi-Fi,** then select the first option.

 The steps for checking your internet connection on Android will vary depending on your Android version and device model.

 You can [check the Wi-Fi speed using a free website](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-free-websites-test-internet-speed/) to confirm its functionality. Try restarting your router to fix any internet problems. If that doesn’t work, contact your internet service provider to find a solution.

 You can also switch from Wi-Fi to mobile data and establish an internet connection. Make sure to have an active data plan. Once your internet connection is stable, you will be able to receive Facebook notifications.

## 2\. Disable Do Not Disturb and Airplane Mode

 Your phone's notifications settings might be a reason why you aren’t receiving alerts. Do Not Disturb mode or Airplane mode might be enabled.

 Disable both modes on your iOS or Android phone. For iPhone X and above, swipe down from the right end of the screen. For iPhone 8 Plus and lower models, you need to swipe up from the bottom. If there's a text saying**On** in your Focus toggle, tap on it to disable it. Also, disable**Airplane Mode** if enabled by tapping the Airplane icon.

 On Android, swipe down your screen from the top and tap to disable**Flight / Airplane** ,**Focus** , and**Do Not Disturb** modes. You'll know they are enabled if colored.

## 3\. Check Notification Permissions for Facebook

1. Go to**Settings** and navigate to**Facebook** .
2. Check**Notifications** to confirm whether they are off or not.
3. Toggle on**Allow Notifications** to turn them back on.

2. Scroll down and tap**Settings & Privacy >** **Settings** .

Tap**Turn On Push Notifications,** and on the next page, allow Facebook to send notifications.

 The Facebook app will load all the pending alerts as soon as you refresh.

## 5\. Restart Your Phone
