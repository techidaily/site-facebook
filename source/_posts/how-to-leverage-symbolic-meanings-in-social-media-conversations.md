## How to Leverage Symbolic Meanings in Social Media Conversations

 Facebook's symbols aren't always easy to understand, particularly for newcomers. The sheer number of symbols to choose from on Facebook can be overwhelming.

 In this article, we take a look at what all of these symbols mean, from the Like button to others you'll come acrossâ€”such as icons on Facebook menus and symbols for your status update.

## Social Facebook Symbols

 The following are some of the more common Facebook icons for social interactions. Most people who use Facebook regularly will recognize them fairly easily.

### Facebook Reaction Icons

 One of the most central images in the Facebook brand is the famous "Like" icon. You can like anything on the site that you can comment on. Just click this button to let everyone know.

 Facebook has expanded the**Like** button to include other symbols or reactions, including Love, Care, Haha, Wow, Sad, and Angry. These symbols express how the post makes you feel.

 To switch to one of these reaction symbols, hover over the**Like** button (or hold the**Like** button on the Facebook mobile app) and the different reaction options will pop up. You then just need to select the reaction you want to use.

### Create Post Symbols

 Aside from the options above, the other icons you'll see on Facebook are the ones that display while you're creating new posts or updating your status.

 Below the text field in your**Create post** feature on a browser, you'll see a few initial symbols. There will be an icon to add a photo or video to your post, an icon to create a live video, and an icon to add a feeling or activity. The mobile app only offers photos and videos as a quick option.

![Create Facebook Post Options](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/create-facebook-post-options.jpg)

 Once in the**Create post** window, there are a lot more icons to navigate. Besides the options already mentioned, there's an icon to tag friends in your post, a check-in feature that adds a location to your post, a flag icon that shares life events, and an ellipsis button for more features.

![Facebook Icons When Creating a Post](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/facebook-icons-when-creating-a-post.jpg)

 Hitting**More** shows the rest of the options that you have when creating a post on Facebook. This includes GIFs and raising money on the website. On mobile, you also get icons for music, the camera, and your post's background color.

 On the**Create post** window, you're also able to add emojis with the convenient**Emoji** icon nearby. The**Feeling/activity** button offers even more ways to share your emotions.

 Hit this button to access two long lists of emojis under two categories. The first tab is titled**Feelings** and contains emojis to express the emotions driving your post.

 The options in**Activities** are a bit more interesting as you can specify what you're doing. Clicking on any of these reveals more symbols for your post.

![Activities Icons for Facebook Post](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/activities-icons-for-facebook-post.jpg)

 While you can only choose one feeling or activity to sit alongside your name on the post, the range of options here is honestly impressive and can benefit more than your personal posts.

 If[Facebook's whitelisting feature](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-facebook-whitelisting/) interests you, for example, exploring this list of Facebook symbols and their meanings can give you ideas on how to promote different brands.

 Some of the most important icons when creating a post on Facebook are in your**Post audience** window, accessible from the button right under your name on the post.

![Symbols for Post Audience Facebook Options](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/symbols-for-post-audience-facebook-options.jpg)

What do these Facebook symbols mean?

* **Globe (Public)** : Make your posts visible to anyone on the internet.
* **Two people (Friends)** : All of your friends can see your posts.
* **Two people, one faded (Friends except)** : Block specific friends from seeing your posts.
* **One person (Specific friends)** : Show your posts to only certain friends.
* **Lock (Only me)** : Only you can see the post.
* **Gear (Custom)** : Add or remove friends or friends lists who can see the post.

 It's very easy to customize the privacy of every Facebook post. There are limits, however. Explore Facebook's notification symbols and meanings all you want, but[seeing who viewed your Facebook profile](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/can-really-see-viewed-facebook-profile/) is still a no-go. Even so, you have plenty of options to play with.

 Another icon that might interest you when posting on your mobile device is a button with Instagram's logo on it. Toggle this feature to share your post on that platform, too.

 All-in-all, creating a Facebook post comes with a great many symbols and tools, but the above are the most essential.

## Icons When Managing Facebook Posts

 It's also important to consider the symbols that show up alongside posts when you click the**Ellipsis** button in the upper right corner of a post window.

 You'll have different options available to you depending on where the post is and who posted it.

 In the example below of a post shared by the Facebook account's owner, we've got the following choices:

* **Pin post** : This lets you pin this post to the top of your profile as the first one that people see.
* **Save post** : This saves the post to a hidden collection that only you have access to.
* **Edit post** : This lets you edit your post, add media, or change the text.
* **Edit audience** : Change who can see this post.
* **Turn off notifications** : Silence the notifications coming in from this post.
* **Turn off translations** : This disables Facebook's translation feature.
* **Edit date** : You can change the date and time of the post with this option.
* **Move to archive** : This removes the post from your timeline without deleting it entirely.
* **Move to Recycle bin** : The post will no longer be on your wall; Facebook deletes these Trashed posts automatically after thirty days.

![Facebook Post Settings](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/facebook-post-settings.jpg)

 Other users' posts offer icons for hiding, snoozing, silencing, unfollowing, reporting, embedding, and more. You can customize your posts and feed to get the most out of Facebook.

## Facebook Navigation Symbols
