## Integrating Social Tools for Superior Collaborative Endeavors on Facebook

 Managing the communications and content of a project is a challenging task. Without a common source for data, it’s an overwhelming task. Workplace from Facebook has a solution to this! Irrespective of the size of your work or project, it's an ideal tool for managing various tasks and the content of projects.

 Moreover, your team members are already familiar with its user interface (UI), as it closely resembles the Facebook platform. Read on to find out how it can become a powerhouse for project management.

## 1\. Create a Dedicate Group for Each Project

[Managing multiple projects](https://www.makeuseof.com/the-best-project-portfolio-management-tools/) at the same time can be hectic and confusing. Skip the confusion with the dedicated group feature of Workplace. In this platform, you can create separate groups for each project to keep the tasks apart.

 The groups you create remain secret, as only group members have permission to contribute. You can add as many groups as you want and add any number of members to a group.

 If you are working in collaboration with another organization, a multi-company group will come in handy. A multi-company group in [Workplace](https://www.workplace.com/) lets you work with people outside your company with equal efficiency.

## 2\. Share Files With Teammates ![A visualization of sharing files and getting shareable links from Workplace](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Workplace-for-PM-File-Sharing.jpg)

 Whether you are working remotely or working from the same office space, you need to share files with your colleagues via online channels. Like any other efficient office suite, Workplace lets you share files with your teammates effortlessly.

 You can add files from your local system into the group. Alternatively, you can also utilize the file-sharing integrations approved by the system admin of the organization. Group admins can add approved integrations to a group for its members to use.

 Check the Integrations tab to find the file-sharing tools. Currently, it supports file sharing apps like Google Drive, Box, OneDrive, Dropbox, SharePoint, etc.

## 3\. Collaborative Work on Files & Feedback

 Using the annotation feature of this workspace suite, your team can share feedback on various files shared in the group. In this way, tracking comments and feedback becomes easier than ever.

 Moreover, all the files shared with the group members are available in the Files tab. So, you don’t have to scroll through the feed to find the file you need.

 This suite also allows you to create an open feedback group. Here, other team members can also offer feedback. By sharing more about the project, like documentation style, design, target audience, etc., you can get more feedback from others and get new perspectives.

## 4\. Tracking Project and Task Progress ![An image showing the notes feature of Workplace](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Workplace-for-PM-Notes.jpg)

 Keeping track of the project progress is easy in Workplace. By putting weekly updates on progress, preferences, and any other exceptional issues in the group, the teammates can inform one another about their tasks.

 In case someone has to share lengthy reports or research findings, they can utilize the Note feature of this platform. To track to-do tasks, you can share action items in the group that the assignee can mark completed when done.

 You may use the mention feature to assign a task to a team member. You can even integrate Smartsheet, Now Virtual Agent, signNow, TaskList, FacilityBot, Elium, askR.ai, Taaskly, etc. apps for better task management and productivity through Workplace.

## 5\. Secure and Common Storage of Files ![A visual showing the Files section of Workplace](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Workplace-for-PM-Files.jpg)

 The Files tab of the Workplace groups organizes all the project files in one place. You can save time by letting Workplace manage your project resources like images, PDFs, Excel sheets, etc. If you use Workplace, you don’t need to keep a track of team members sharing project-related sensitive documents through different platforms, putting confidential data at risk.

 Your team can upload files to a group through several channels like Posts, Chat, Topics, Learning, Media, etc. But, all the files go straight into the Files tab. From here, you can easily manage file access, version control, and delete the file if it’s unnecessary.

 It’s important to know that you can only upload up to 50 MB of files through any other channel than Workplace Chat. From Workplace Chat, you can upload files that are up to 75 MB in size. The file size limit helps the team to stay productive by sharing small files effortlessly without facing any issues with upload speed bandwidth.

 This may seem like a low file upload limit. However, the Workplace supports uploading massive video files up to 4 GB. So, whenever you need to create a video tutorial for the Learning or Knowledge Library section, you can always upload long HD videos.

## 6\. Real-Time Messaging Through Workplace Chat

 When a team works on a project from remote locations, there is no alternative to real-time communication. However, it’s not always possible to connect via audio or video calls while working from home. That is why you need to have an instant chat option in your collaborative workspace.

 Workplace also offers this feature to its users through the Workplace Chat app. Download it on your Android or iOS phone and stay in touch on the go. Use it to get an instant answer to an important query. Groups with 250 or fewer members can use this option.

## 7\. Audio or Video Call for Seamless Communication

 For a remote or hybrid team, collaborative work is impossible without audio/video calls. If you use Workplace From Facebook [for project management](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-free-asana-alternatives-project-management/) , you don’t need to use any additional app for these purposes. Making a call to your teammate is just a click away with Workplace.

 Up to 50 team members can join in an audio or video meeting through Workplace from Facebook's meeting feature. You can utilize this facility for weekly team meetings or group discussions.

 You can also engage in quick one-on-one calls with the group members. Integration of virtual calling apps like Zoom, BlueJeans, and Cisco Webex Meetings are also available.

## 8\. Post Pinning Feature for Quick Reference

 You can also pin a post or content on the group page, similar to a Facebook page or group. In every group, there are vital project instructions, goals, deadlines, and resources. Content pinning ensures that the team members effortlessly find the content needed to work on a project.

 If you want, you can pin multiple posts without any trouble. You can also decide which pinned post should stay on top of the others. Remember that only the group admin can pin a post in the Workplace group.

## Managing Multiple Projects Is Easy

 The functionalities that you saw above are basic needs for any project. Workplace from Facebook satisfies all of these features efficiently through a no-brainer UI.

 If your project data like to-do lists, workflows, product/service mockups, reference content, etc., are on more than one tool, bring them to one central tool like Workplace for free. It's also smart to know how Workplace competes with other project management workspaces before making the final decision.
