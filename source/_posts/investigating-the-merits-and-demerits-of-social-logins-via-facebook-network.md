## Investigating the Merits & Demerits of Social Logins via Facebook Network

 You've probably noticed that more and more websites and apps are giving you the option to log in with your Facebook account. While this may be convenient, there are also some risks involved. Some of these risks are obvious, like the fact that you're giving the app access to your Facebook account. But other risks may not be so obvious.

 In this article, you'll learn about the pros and cons of using Facebook to log into other apps, so you can decide if it's worth the risk.

## What Is Facebook Login and How Does It Work?

![Laptop showing Facebook page](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Laptop-showing-Facebook-page.jpg)

 Facebook Login is a feature that allows you to log into other apps using your Facebook account. When you use Facebook Login, the app will ask for permission to access your public profile and email address. If you grant the app permission, it will log you in without you having to enter your username and password.

 Some apps may also ask for additional permissions, such as access to your friend list or the ability to post on your behalf. But you can always decline these additional permissions.

## Pros of Using Facebook Login

 There are some advantages to using Facebook Login. Here are a few of the most notable ones:

![Facebook thumbs up](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Facebook-thumbs-up.jpg)

### 1\. It's Convenient

 We all know the feeling: you just downloaded a new app, and you're eager to start using it, but then you have to create a whole new account. With Facebook Login, you can skip all that and get right to the good stuff.

 You wouldn't want to use Facebook Login for every app or website (more on that later), but it can be a time-saver sometimes.

### 2\. It's One Less Password to Remember

 If you're like most people, you've probably got a lot of different passwords to keep track of. Using Facebook Login means one less password to remember. Now, you just need to remember your Facebook password.

### 3\. It's More Secure Than Using a Shared Password

 Have you ever used the same password for multiple accounts? If so, then you know that it's not the most secure way to do things. But when you use Facebook to log into other apps, your credentials are more secure because they're linked to your Facebook account—an account that likely has [Facebook's two-factor authentication](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/use-2fa-facebook-without-phone-number/) enabled.

### 4\. It Allows You to Connect With Friends on Other Platforms

 When you use your Facebook login on other apps, it can be a great way to connect with friends who are also using those apps. For example, if you're playing a game that requires a social media login, logging in with Facebook will allow you to see which of your friends also play that game.

### 5\. It Allows You to Back Up and Restore Game Progress

 If you've ever had to start a game from scratch after switching devices, then you know how frustrating it can be. When you use Facebook Login for games, your progress is backed up and can be restored if you need to switch devices.

### 6\. Some Platforms Require It

 Some platforms will only let you log in with Facebook—no other option is available. So if you want to use them, you have no choice but to use your Facebook login. Messenger is one example of this. Oculus used to be one, too, but it now requires a [Meta account instead, which is technically the same thing](https://www.makeuseof.com/meta-account-facebook-account-oculus-quest-2/) .

## Cons of Using Facebook Login

 As with anything, there are also some disadvantages to using Facebook Login. Here are a few of the potential risks:

![Facebook thumbs down](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/facebook-gaa72923bc_1920.jpg)

### 1\. It's Not as Private as You Might Think

 Whenever you're logging into something with your Facebook account, you're giving that app or website access to some of your personal information. The amount of information that is shared depends on the permissions that you've granted, but it can be a lot.

### 2\. It's Easy to Accidentally Share Too Much Information

 Although Facebook gives users the ability to control how much information they share with apps, it's easy to accidentally share too much. For example, you might download an app and grant it permission to access your public profile, but then later realize that it also has access to your friend list.

### 3\. It's a Single Point of Failure

 If your Facebook account is hacked, then the attacker would have access to all the apps and websites that you've logged into with Facebook. That could be a lot of damage—especially if you use your Facebook login for sensitive accounts.

### 4\. Some Apps Sell Your Data

 Although Facebook has strict policies about how third-party apps can use your data, not all apps follow those rules. In some cases, an app that requires Facebook Login may sell your data to advertisers.

### 5\. You're Giving Facebook Even More Data About You

 Privacy concerns is one of the major reasons [why some people loathe Facebook](https://www.makeuseof.com/why-do-people-hate-facebook/) . If you're worried about Facebook having too much data about you, then using your Facebook login for other apps is only going to make that worse.

### 6\. You Might Get Locked Out of Your Account

 If you ever forget your Facebook password, you could be locked out of all the apps and websites that you've logged into with Facebook. So it's important to have a backup method for accessing those accounts—just in case.

## Deciding Whether or Not to Use Facebook Login for Other Apps

 The best way to decide whether or not to use Facebook login for other apps is to weigh the pros and cons. Consider how important convenience and security are to you. Also, think about how much data you're comfortable sharing with Facebook and other companies.

 If you're concerned about privacy, then you may want to limit the amount of data you share by only using Facebook Login for apps that don't require a lot of personal information. Or, you may decide not to use Facebook Login at all.

 On the other hand, if you're more concerned about convenience, then using Facebook Login might be the way to go. Just be sure to carefully review the permissions that each app is asking for before you grant access.

## Facebook Login: Convenience at a Price

 The bottom line is that using Facebook Login for other apps can be convenient, but it comes at a price. You're giving up some privacy and security for the convenience of not having to remember multiple usernames and passwords.

 Think carefully about whether or not the convenience is worth the trade-off before you use Facebook Login for other apps.
