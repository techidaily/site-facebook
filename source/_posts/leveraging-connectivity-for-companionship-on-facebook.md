## Leveraging Connectivity for Companionship on Facebook

 Tinder, Hinge, Bumble—there is no shortage of dating apps nowadays. It seems that if you want to meet a significant other, the only way to do it is with an app.

 But if you feel that you’re going nowhere with the popular dating apps, why not try a new one? While Facebook itself is not new, its dating feature was only launched in 2019\. In this article, we’ll explain how it works, and the benefits of using this social media platform specifically for dating.

## What Is Facebook Dating?

 When we talk about Facebook Dating, it's important to note that we don't mean that you should[use your Facebook profile to ask people out](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/4-effective-tips-girl-facebook/) . Facebook Dating is a whole feature in itself, which is located inside the Facebook app. So just like there's a whole separate area for Marketplace, there's an area for Dating.

 When you navigate into this area, you are prompted to create a dating profile, which will be different from your normal Facebook profile. You can choose what photos and information to include. And best of all, this will only be visible to other people who use the Dating feature. So your friends or family most likely will never see that profile, anything you post there, or know that you even use it.

 Facebook Dating is available in the US, most of Europe, parts of Asia, and South America. You can see the full list of countries on the[Facebook website](https://www.facebook.com/help/2495451450696932) . Also, keep in mind that you have to be at least 18 years old to join, have a profile that is at least 30-days old, and not set off Facebook's spam filters.

## How to Set Up Your Facebook Dating Profile

 So as we've already mentioned, if you want to use Facebook for dating, you need to set up a new, separate profile. The great thing about this app is that you don’t actually need to download anything new to your phone. If you already have Facebook installed, you’re good to go. It's important to note you can't use Dating on your desktop, only on the mobile app.

To create your Facebook Dating profile, just follow these steps :

1. Launch your Facebook app and tap the three lines on the top-right.
2. Scroll down until you see the**Dating** button and tap it. This will launch the set-up
3. Tap**Get Started** .
4. Pick who can see your profile on this page. Do you want friends of friends to be able to view it? If not, tap the**Privacy Settings** and toggle the button.
5. On the next screen, you can update your personal information, or remove details you don’t want to share.

1. Pick who you want to date (Men, Women, or Everyone).
2. Agree to the app’s data settings.
3. Allow Facebook access to your location.
4. The next questions are related to your height, whether you have children, and your education. You can choose to answer or skip.
5. Now, it’s time to pick your picture. You can use your Facebook profile pic, take a new one, or choose one from an album on Facebook.
6. Finally, you have to agree to let Facebook use your information across their products if you want to create the profile.

 Congratulations, you’ve now created your Facebook Dating profile. Once you’ve done that, you’ll be active on the app. You’ll be able to get likes and find matches.

 However, you may want to beef up your profile a little more before you start swiping, to ensure you match with people who you actually want to date. To do that, tap the**Profile** button on the top left corner of the screen.

 There, you can add more pictures and an intro about yourself, change your details, connect to your Instagram, and more. There’s also a section for you to add your**Hobbies** .

 If you already know[how to use Tinder like a pro](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-tinder/) , or have been using other dating apps, it’ll be fairly easy for you to pick up this one as well. Its main interface is the swipe system that other apps have.

 But let’s back up a little, to explain exactly how everything works. First, every time you want to use Facebook for dating, you’ll need to launch the app, press the three lines at the top, and tap**Dating** . Just like you did when you set up your profile.

 Then, you’ll land on the Dating home screen. This screen has a lot going on, so we’ll take you through it, step by step.

 On the top, you can see the buttons for**Profile** ,**Liked you** , and**Matches** . The first one, as we’ve mentioned, is for you to edit your details. In the second, you can see all the people who already liked your profile.

 This is one of the great benefits of Facebook Dating. If you press this button, you can start swiping left (no) or right (yes) on people who have already expressed their interest. If you swipe right on anyone in this section, you’ll immediately match, and be able to message them. And the last tab is where you’ll see those matches and can start your conversations.

 Back at the home screen, under the three buttons, there’s a picture for you to like or reject. If you tap it, you can enter a mode similar to Tinder, where you can swipe left or right on people whether they liked you or not.

 To adjust the preferences on this page, go back to the home screen and press the settings on the top right. There, you can set an age range, a distance from you, education preferences, and more.

 When you scroll further down the home screen, you’ll see**More to Explore** . This is where Facebook Dating shines. First, there is the button for**Shared Interests** . If you use it to fill in your hobbies, it will improve your matches.

 Then, there’s the button for**Events in Common.** This is where Facebook draws from its day-to-day use to help you find your next date. You can swipe through people who attended the same events as you in the past, or RSVP’d to any of the same upcoming events as you. The second one is especially appealing, as you can match before the event, with the goal of meeting up there.

**Groups in Common** also works in the same fashion. It lets you match with people who are members of the same Facebook groups as you, which automatically gives you something to talk about in the first message. And if you have any friends in common, the app will also let you know.

## Facebook Dating Leverages the Power of Social Networking

 The unique features of Groups and Events help can cut down on the awkwardness of the first conversation. They create an immediate connection and make it feel like you’re not talking to a complete stranger.

 So if you’re a regular Facebook user, you’ll probably enjoy using the Dating app, as it connects to a lot of the features you’re used to. The app is also completely free, with no hidden fees, in exchange for Facebook using your data for their ads. If you’re ok with that, you might want to give this app a try.
