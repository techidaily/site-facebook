## Leveraging Facebook Groups for Effective Surveys

 Facebook allows you to post polls to help you collect opinions from your Pages, Groups, and Stories’ followers. It’s easy to add a poll with your specific question to any of your Facebook properties.

 In this guide, we’ll show you how to create a poll on Facebook—specifically for posts on Pages, in Groups, and on your Stories.

## How to Create a Poll on a Facebook Page

 Facebook supports adding a poll to your Facebook Page, and this way you can collect responses from the people who follow it.

To create a poll on your page from Facebook’s desktop site:

1. Access your Facebook Page in your preferred browser.
2. When the page opens, click**Publishing Tools** in the left sidebar.
3. Click**Create Post** at the top of the screen. This will compose the new post where you’ll add a poll.
4. In the compose box, click the cog icon at the bottom-left corner and select**Classic Post Creation Tool** . This is because the modern post tool lacks the option to add a poll.
5. On the post creation screen, click the three-dots menu and select**Poll** .
6. Type your poll question at the top.
7. Specify poll options in the given fields.
8. Choose a duration for your poll from the given dropdown menu.
9. Click**Share Now** at the bottom to publish the newly created poll on your Facebook Page.

## Start a Poll in a Facebook Group

 You can add a poll as a post to your Facebook Groups as well. The procedure to do this is similar to how you add a poll to a Facebook Page.

 A Group poll helps collect responses from its members. Here's how you set one up::

1. Access your Facebook Group on the Facebook desktop site.
2. Click the**Create a public post** option.
3. In the Create Post box, click the three-dots menu at the bottom and select**Poll** . This turns your normal post into a poll post.
4. Type the question for your poll at the top.
5. Add your poll options in the**Option 1** ,**Option 2** , and**Option 3** fields. Click**X** next to an option to remove it. Click the**Add option** button to add an extra answer to your poll.
6. Click the**Poll options** button to choose how the group members can interact with your poll. Here, you can decide if members can select multiple options in your poll. You can also decide if group members can add their own options.
7. Finally, click**Post** at the bottom to publish your poll.

## How to Post a Poll to a Facebook Story

 You must use Facebook’s iOS or Android app to add a poll to a Facebook Story. This is because Facebook’s desktop version doesn’t offer the option to make a poll in your Stories.
