## LinkedIn & Facebook Synergy for Job Advancement

 Facebook is one of the most helpful social media sites to help you grow in your career. You can use the social network to achieve your professional goals instead of mindless scrolling. Here are some simple tips for using Facebook for career growth.

## 1\. Learning and Upskilling ![Searching for Groups on Facebook](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/muo-cover-photo-1680-x-640-px-50.jpg)

 Facebook offers free ways to develop and learn skills through groups.[Influencer Marketing Hub's Facebook statistics](https://influencermarketinghub.com/facebook-statistics/) show over 10 million Facebook groups, with over 1.8 billion monthly users as of August 2022\. These groups help users connect with other people who have similar interests.

 Find specific groups based on your needs and choose the ones with an active moderator.[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/help/199554316755501) says you can join up to 6,000 groups, an overwhelming resource for your varied interests. Groups can help you build tech skills, transition to a new career, turn a hobby into a career, learn [how to get started as a freelancer](https://www.makeuseof.com/get-started-as-freelancer-guide/) , know what's it like to work in a specific industry, and more.

 Explore several [useful ways to discover new Facebook groups](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/5-awesome-ways-discover-new-facebook-groups/) . The most common method is using the search bar. Type the topic you want to search for, then click**Groups** in the left-hand panel. You can also use search phrases like "groups about" and filter the results by city.

 After finding content that you like in a group, use the Facebook**Save link** feature, so you can go back to review it:

1. On the Facebook post, click the horizontal ellipsis (three dots) on the upper right-hand side.
2. Click**Save Link** to add the post to your collection.

## 2\. Professional Networking ![Close up shot of a Facebook profile named Juan Pablo](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/muo-cover-photo-1680-x-640-px-51.jpg)

 Being part of a Facebook group is a convenient way to start conversations naturally and nurture new relationships. Instead of being a passive observer, contribute to the discussion and engage with others. As you build your reputation, other professionals in the group might take notice and hire you.

 When connecting with strangers on Facebook, send a personal message in a public thread first. Only add them as friends if you have their express approval. You might get mistaken for a spammer or stalker if you randomly send messages and add strangers to your network.

## 3\. Landing More Clients ![Open laptop showing the Facebook ads webpage](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/muo-cover-photo-1680-x-640-px-52.jpg)

 With Facebook's large user base, you'll benefit from reaching potential clients.[Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/268136/top-15-countries-based-on-number-of-facebook-users/#:~:text=With%20around%202.9%20billion%20monthly,most%20popular%20social%20media%20worldwide.) says that Facebook has more than 2.9 million monthly active users worldwide. Given the numbers, it's worth investing in knowing [how to get clients on Facebook for work](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-get-clients-facebook-work/) if you're a freelancer or an entrepreneur.

 Facebook makes it easy to connect with clients. You can create your own Facebook page to advertise your services. You can also join or start a Facebook group to grow your audience organically. Another way would be to use Facebook Ads to market yourself to clients more quickly.

 Take advantage of Facebook's Ads features to get connected to the right clients. When you create an ad, you can add photos, use a call to action, and specify your target market. You can also control your ad spends to keep your expenses within your budget.

## 4\. Job Hunting ![pixel image of a hand clicking "dream job" placed on the foreground of a keyboard](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/muo-cover-photo-1680-x-640-px-54.jpg)

 Facebook's update on [Jobs on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/982945655901961) shows that the feature is shutting down. However, you can still use several other Facebook features for your job search. Members in Facebook groups can also post job opportunities if allowed by the moderator. Even if they don't, you can try other ways to look for a job on Facebook.

 If you'd like to look for work at a specific company, follow the company's Facebook page. If the page is active, they might post updates on job opportunities. Also, you can search for a link to their website on their Facebook page and explore their career portal.

 Making a public post that you're open to work is also one of the easiest ways to let people know you're looking for a new job. Just make sure that your company knows that you're leaving and that you've applied the [ways to clean up your Facebook account](https://www.makeuseof.com/ways-to-clean-up-facebook-account/) before doing this.

 Alternatively, you can keep the details of your job hunt within your circle of connected friends and family. Keep your resume updated and saved on your computer, so you can easily share it when they ask.

## 5\. Promoting Your Brand and Expertise ![Meta for Business webpage](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/muo-cover-photo-1680-x-640-px-55.jpg)

 Think of yourself as a brand that's promoting its services on Facebook. You want to build your expertise, so you'll be first on the list when clients need to hire a professional. To be more effective in marketing yourself, create a page and populate it with helpful and engaging content.

 There are several [reasons why a Facebook page is better than a personal profile for branding](https://www.makeuseof.com/why-facebook-page-is-better-for-branding/) . The most apparent benefit is having access to helpful marketing features that would otherwise be absent from a private Facebook page. Some of these are access to analytics and Facebook ads.

 Learning [how to create a Facebook business page](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-create-a-facebook-business-page/) is easy and intuitive. Go to [Meta for Business](https://www.facebook.com/business/) and click the**Start Now** button in the upper right-hand corner. Click**Create Page** . You can create a page name, choose a category, and upload a profile picture from here.

 Feel free to add more details to your page once you publish it. Creating a social media calendar in advance will help you post regularly. Also, remember to respond to your followers to keep them engaged and interested. You don't have to create a persona or an alter-ego to build your brand. You have a unique voice and a story. Use that to attract clients.

## 6\. Researching Companies and Industry Trends ![Confused Woman Using Her Laptop](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/woman-confused-on-laptop.jpg)

 Career growth is not limited to finding a dream job, looking for more clients, and promoting yourself as a professional. If you want to stay relevant and become a leader, you must know the ins and outs of your industry. Be on the lookout for information and news that could affect your career in the future.

 To keep yourself updated about what's happening in your industry, follow online news sites, leaders on LinkedIn, and company Facebook pages. Learning about the latest products, strategies, problems, and opinions in your industry will help you make career decisions. And who knows, you might even need this information to answer job interview questions effectively.

## Grow Your Career on Facebook

 Facebook is a helpful tool for career growth. You can use it for job searching, networking, growing your influence, expanding your reach, and keeping abreast of relevant issues in your industry. If you're already spending much time on Facebook, consider rerouting your energy to growing your career.

 More career opportunities can open up using the right social media platform. You may not have the time and energy to have a presence on all the social media networks, but you can choose the platform that will help you the most in your job hunt.
