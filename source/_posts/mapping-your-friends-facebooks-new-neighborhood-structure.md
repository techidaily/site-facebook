## Mapping Your Friends: Facebook's New Neighborhood Structure

 Facebook Neighborhoods is a new feature that lets you and your neighbors create an online community based on your location.

 The social network started [testing Neighborhoods in October 2020](https://www.makeuseof.com/facebook-testing-neighborhoods-rival-nextdoor/) , and it has now expanded testing this feature further.

## Connect Through Neighborhoods With Nearby Residents

 Facebook Neighborhoods should help people connect with others living nearby. According to a post on the [Facebook Newsroom](https://about.fb.com/news/2021/05/connecting-local-communities-on-facebook/) , Neighborhoods can be used for "rallying to support local businesses, asking for recommendations and tips in local groups, offering support, or meeting neighbors who share common interests."

 It is already possible to connect with your neighbors on Facebook through groups. But Facebook decided to make this process even more accessible and came up with a new tool designed specifically for this purpose.

 You are not obligated to use Facebook Neighborhoods. So it is entirely up to you to decide whether you want to join it or not.

 This feature is available through the Facebook app on Android and iOS. It is a separate section located in the Facebook app, so you'll need to create a Neighborhoods profile to use this tool. Also, to be eligible to use Facebook Neighborhoods, you should be at least 18 years old.

 You can join your own neighborhood and interact there with your neighbors by writing posts, taking part in discussions, participating in polls, or answering questions. If you wish, you can also check out Nearby Neighborhoods to explore neighborhoods located nearby.

 To find like-minded neighbors and help them get to know you, you can specify your interests, add favorite places, and put together a bio for your account.

 Currently, Facebook Neighborhoods has rolled out in Canada and should soon become available in some US cities, including Charlotte, NC; San Diego, CA; Baton Rouge, LA; and Newark, NJ.

## Is the Facebook Neighborhoods Tool Safe?

 Facebook constantly tries to moderate the countless number of posts that go through its platform. However, it's possible that this new tool will bring some new challenges for Facebook where that's concerned.

 Still, the company seems sure that Neighborhoods will be safe and inclusive. If the content created in Facebook Neighborhoods violates the Neighborhoods Guidelines, it will be instantly taken down. Also, you can block anyone that looks suspicious to you without them knowing.

## Facebook Continues to Impress Its Users

 Facebook is doing everything it can to make sure that people don't quit, including rolling out a steady stream of new features.

 A [speed dating service](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-try-facebooks-new-speed-dating-app-sparked/) , new [social audio features](https://www.makeuseof.com/facebook-introduces-social-audio-features-compete-clubhouse/) , and [an in-app Spotify miniplayer](https://www.makeuseof.com/listen-spotify-miniplayer-facebook-app/) are just a few of the recent additions.

Which leaves us to wonder, what's next?
