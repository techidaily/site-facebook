## Master Silence: No More Comments on Your Online Sharing

 Almost everyone loves people leaving comments on their Facebook posts. However, the comments section could get hijacked by trolls, with offensive comments, or by spammers, littering the section with unsolicited ads. In any such case, you'll want to regain control of your post.

 Let's find out how you can disable and manage the comment section of your Facebook post when it becomes necessary.

## Things to Know About Turning Off Comments on Facebook

 Facebook limits what control you have over your personal posts. Because of this, you cannot fully disable comments on your Facebook posts. But you can limit who can comment on your posts.

 However, in a Facebook group where you are an admin, Facebook allows you to completely turn off comments on a post.

## How to Manage Comments on Your Personal Facebook Posts

 You can choose between using the Facebook mobile app on your phone or its web version on a PC to manage comments on your profile posts. This guide will show you how to do using both versions.

### How to Manage Comments on the Facebook App

 Here's how to manage comments on your posts using the Facebook mobile app:

Close

1. Identify the Facebook post you’d like to disable comments on.
2. Tap on the**three dots** in the top-right corner of the post.
3. From the menu, select**Who can comment on your post** .
4. On the next page, select one of the three options on the page. Expectedly, your default option should be**Public** . So, you can choose either**Friends** or**Profiles and Pages you mention** as applicable. Tap**Done** to confirm your decision.

### How to Manage Comments Using Facebook Web

 On the web version of Facebook, the process is a bit more complicated. Here's how to manage comments for personal posts on Facebook from your computer.

* Log in to [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/) on your browser.
* Click on the**upside-down triangle** .

![screenshot of facebook home page](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/screenshot-of-facebook-homepage-1.JPG)

* Click on**Settings and privacy > Settings > Privacy** .
* Select**Public Posts** on the side menu.

* Click on**Public Post Comments** or the area next to it and select your preferred commenting audience, from**Public** ,**Friends of Friends** , or**Friends** .

 And that's all you need to manage comments on your Facebook post.

## How to Disable Post Comments in a Facebook Group

 Unlike personal posts, Facebook allows group administrators to completely disable the comment section of a post in a Facebook group. To do this, follow these steps:

![screenshot showing facebook group post](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/screenshot-showing-facebook-group-post.jpg)

![screenshot showing how to turn off comments on facebook group](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/screenshot-showing-how-to-turn-off-comments-on-facebook-group.jpg)

Close

1. Identify the post for which you'd like to turn off its comment.
2. Click on the**three dots** in the top-right corner of the post.
3. Select**Turn off commenting** .

 Using the web version, the steps are the same. Just make sure to look out for the three dots in the top-right corner of the post.

 And that's it. Facebook immediately disables the comment section of the post. However, the old comments remain under the post.

## Take Control of the Comment Section on Your Facebook Posts

 Getting multiple opinions on an issue can be a good thing. However, if you're only sharing personal content, you may want to limit the ability to use the comment section to just those you're close to.

 A similar rule applies to groups, if you're not sharing something that requires input from other members, you can simply turn off commenting on the post with the steps shared above.
