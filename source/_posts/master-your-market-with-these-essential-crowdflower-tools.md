## Master Your Market with These Essential CrowdFlower Tools

 Crowdfire is a feature-rich social media management tool that helps you increase your social media presence and grow engagement. Its features are particularly beneficial for individual social media users who want to remain active across various platforms without spending much time.

 By utilizing the following Crowdfire features, you can become worry-free and handle all your social accounts with ease.

## 1\. Scheduling Social Media Posts ![Visualizing Crowdfire app features Scheduling Posts](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Crowdfire-App-Features-Scheduling-Posts.jpg)

 While drafting a social media post, it will offer you three options for publishing time. Besides publishing immediately, you can also [schedule at a specific date and time](https://www.makeuseof.com/ways-to-schedule-posts-to-multiple-social-media-platforms/) of your choice, or you can let the app publish it at the best time according to your audience activity.

 You can also schedule a bulk amount of posts at once during your free time or on the weekend, meaning you don’t have to disrupt your daily routine.

 The tool lets you save post drafts and review them anytime before posting them. It also lists your published and scheduled posts so that you can keep track of them. Add a CSV file containing the date and time for all the scheduled posts, and Crowdfire will publish them at their designated time.

 The**Master Calendar** feature (with a paid plan) helps schedule, manage, and move posts for all your accounts from one place. For post scheduling in general, you can select the best time from your end, or you can enter your timezone and let the tool decide the best time for you.

## 2\. Support for Multiple Social Platforms ![Image showing Multiple Social Platforms compatibility of Crowdfire](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Crowdfire-App-Features-Support-for-Multiple-Social-Platforms .jpg)

 The number of social media is on the rise, and surely you don't want to miss out on any of those. However, it may not be feasible for you to be active on all the platforms due to the lack of time.

 Crowdfire supports Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Instagram, Tiktok, YouTube, and Linkedin. Apart from these, it offers support for LinkedIn company profiles. If you are a free user, you can manage only three social media platforms from this list.

 If you want to remain active in multiple channels, but do not have enough time to spend on them individually, this feature will be your lifesaver. Add the channels where you want to be active and start posting on them right away.

## 3\. Content Curation

 You don't always have to write something unique from your end on social media. Sharing news, articles, and images is equally effective for keeping the audience interested. Crowdfire makes the task easier with its features like Article Curation and Image Curation.

 Go to the Content Curation tab and select the topics of your choice. You can also choose a broad topic like Art, and the tool will suggest a variety of subtopics or related topics. Then, choose the exact topics and go to the Articles or Images section.

 Now, you will see several trending articles and images of your selected topic. Click on the**Share** button to share on your preferred social media. Thus, you will have a regular social presence without having to write posts from scratch.

 You can also connect your accounts on various blogs (WordPress, Medium), video websites (YouTube, Vimeo), and e-commerce websites (Shopify, Etsy) for scheduling any new posts to your social media directly from Crowdfire.

## 4\. RSS Feed From Other Blogs and Websites ![Visualization of RSS feed activation section in Crowdfire](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Crowdfire-App-Features-RSS-Feed.jpg)

 If there are some websites or blogs that publish works that interest you, use the RSS feed feature of Crowdfire (with a paid plan) to get them all in the tool dashboard. Add any website address, and if that site allows, you can view all of its posts in this tool.

 You don’t have to visit those sites separately regularly to check if they published any new articles. This feed will inform you about any latest posts on that website and save you time. Thus, you can directly share them on your social accounts.

## 5\. Hashtag Recommendations ![Image showing hashtag suggestion in Crowdfire](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Crowdfire-App-Features-Hash-Tags-Suggestions.jpg)

 These days,[hashtags are important social media](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/what-is-a-hashtag/) . This short and specific content labeling helps users find the relevant posts on a topic. If you want your post to reach more people on any social channel, you need to add several happening hashtags.

 As you start writing a post from the Crowdfire tool, it will suggest a list of suitable hashtags. This tool displays all the trending hashtags on your chosen topics.

## 6\. Access Social Media Analytics Data ![Social Media Analytics feature visualization in Crowdfire](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Crowdfire-App-Features-Social-Media-Analytics.jpg)

 Checking your analytics is essential if you want to grow your social media account, regardless of the platform you use.

 The Analytics feature of Crowdfire is sufficient to deliver your complete social performance information in a click. It can display basic data from your social accounts on Instagram, Facebook pages, Twitter, Pinterest, LinkedIn company profile, and Youtube.

**Advanced Analytics** will let you track social performance data of yesterday, seven days, 30 days, 90 days, or any other custom date range. Furthermore, you can even compare your social data to previous time periods in this tool. You may use the**Advanced Analytics** feature for the same social accounts mentioned above.

 If you are the admin of a Facebook page, you can also perform competitor analysis. It will help you by providing unique content ideas for your page. Apart from these, the tool offers a custom report builder. You can create customized analytics reports of the preferred time range with this.

## 7\. Tracking the Social Mentions ![Visualization of Mentions feature in Crowdfire](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Crowdfire-App-Features-Mentions.jpg)

 Imagine you have five social accounts, and you post a total of 15 posts in a day. Now, it’s not possible to check out each and every comment of all these posts. While not all comments are meant for you, missing out on the mentions is not something you would want, if you are to have an engaging relationship with your audience.

 With**Crowdfire Mentions** (with a paid plan), monitoring mentions of all your social accounts becomes easier. You will get all the mentions in the Crowdfire dashboard Inbox. The best thing about this feature is, it displays the total number of mentions with pending and closed mentions. Thus, you can keep track of the mentions you replied to and the ones you didn’t.

## 8\. Web Listening ![Illustration of Web Listening feature of Crowdfire](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Crowdfire-App-Features-Web-Listening.jpeg)

 Social media and internet conversations produce a large amount of unstructured data. If you take social media presence seriously, you need to identify and assess what others are talking about you. Social media or web listening is a vital intelligence tool to gain insights about your audience.

 The**Web Listening** feature (with a paid plan) of Crowdfire lets you know how many people mentioned you or your brand in a time frame. It also informs you of information like positive and negative discussions, social media reach, interactions, etc.
