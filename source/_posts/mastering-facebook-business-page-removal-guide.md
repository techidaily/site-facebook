* Facebook will schedule the page for permanent deletion in 30 days, but you can reactivate it within that time frame.

## How to Delete Classic Facebook Business Pages

 If you can't delete your Facebook business page after following the steps above, you may have a legacy page. This is because legacy Facebook pages have slightly different behavior. For instance, you may be unable to switch profiles and use your Facebook page as a normal user account. If that's the case, use the steps below.

### On the mobile app, follow these steps to delete your Facebook business page

1. Tap your profile photo or hamburger menu in the top right or bottom right and select**Pages** .
2. Choose a page from the list.
3. Tap the**Settings** icon in the top right and select**General** .
4. Scroll down the page and tap**Delete \[Page name\]** .
5. Next, tap**Delete page** to confirm.

Close

On the Facebook website, follow these steps:

 Tap your profile photo in the top right and select**See all profiles > See all pages** . This will take you to the page's management section. In the left sidebar, scroll down and select**Settings** .

![Settings on a legacy Facebook page](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/legacy-facebook-page-settings.jpg)

 Look for**Remove Page** at the bottom of the page and select it. Next, click**Delete \[Page name\]** .

![Deleting a legacy Facebook page](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/delete-legacy-facebook-page.jpg)

 After that, click**Delete page** from the pop-up to confirm and finish the process.

## What Happens When You Delete a Facebook Page?

 Like with [deleting a Facebook account](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/delete-facebook-account/) , Facebook will not purge your account immediately. Instead, it will be scheduled for permanent deletion in 30 days. That means you can get your Facebook page back after deleting it. Of course, you need to do that before the 30 days are over. However, there are a few things to bear in mind.

 Facebook will instantly unpublish your page, so it won't be visible on the platform anymore.

![Facebook app opened on a smartphone next to a laptop](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/iphone-with-facebook-profile-open-on-screen.jpg)

 If you decide you don't want to delete your page, you can restore it by selecting your profile photo in the top right, then navigating to **Settings & privacy > Settings > Privacy > Your Facebook information > Reactivation** and clicking the**Reactivate** button before the 30-day period ends.

 For classic Facebook pages, click your profile photo in the top right, select**See all profiles > See all pages,** then tap the**three-dot menu** adjacent to your deactivated page and select**Publish** from the popup to cancel the deletion.

 If you want to give yourself a break from running a Facebook page but don't want to delete it completely, you can unpublish it, so only admins can see it. You will also not lose your followers if you do this. Otherwise, if you're doing this as part of your process to [stop using Facebook for good](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/stop-using-facebook/) , you don't have to do anything else.

## Delete Your Facebook Page for Good

 Managing a Facebook page can be tough. So if you created a page and gave up on the business idea, there's no need to keep a dormant Facebook page on your account. You can get rid of it by following the instructions above.

 Just remember deleting means the page is gone for good. Thankfully, Facebook provides a 30-day window within which you can reactivate your page if you feel like you've made a mistake.
