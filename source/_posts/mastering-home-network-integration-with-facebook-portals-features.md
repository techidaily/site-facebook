## Mastering Home Network Integration with Facebook Portals' Features

 Video chatting has become increasingly popular due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Social distancing and isolation became the norm in the wake of the pandemic as restrictions were imposed on physical gatherings to curb the coronavirus.

 Thanks to video technology, we were able to see and interact with the people that mattered to us. And while the world is slowly returning to normality, video chats are here to stay, with people still spending time with their loved ones on video calls.

 In this article, we explain how to set up and use a Facebook Portal TV for video chats with family and friends...

## Why Video Chat on a TV?

 Smartphones are unarguably the most popular devices for video chats. Their portability makes them easy and convenient to carry around. However, the user experience of video chatting on a smartphone falls short in some areas.

 If you are video chatting on your phone, you are likely to hold the phone with your hand. The proximity of the phone’s camera isn't flattering to your face as it makes your face look bigger.

 Holding your phone or tablet for too long while video chatting is also a problem. After a few minutes, you'll likely get tired.

 Are you having a conference call? Your phone's screen is probably so small, as it makes the participants of the call look too small.

 Video chatting on a TV helps you to prevent the above-mentioned challenges and enhances your video chatting experience.

[Making group conference calls](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/6-excellent-apps-to-place-group-and-conference-calls/) is a lot more fun on a TV as you can see the people you are chatting with clearly due to the size of the screen.

 Having large images of your family, friends, and/or colleagues on the TV screen during a video call creates an illusion of proximity.

## What Is the Facebook Portal TV?

 The [Portal TV](https://portal.facebook.com/) is a smart product from Facebook that allows you to make TV-based video calls in the comfort of your home. If your friends and family don’t have the Portal TV, you can also video chat with them from their smartphones and tablets via WhatsApp or Messenger.

 To enhance the user experience during calls, the Portal TV has a built-in smart sound that projects your voice and reduces background noise for audio clarity.

 While you can have personal one-on-one chats with your close friends and family, there is room for you to chat with as many as 50 people in Messenger Rooms.

 Calls on the Portal TV are lively, with the camera automatically panning and zooming to create on-screen movement. It also keeps everyone in the frame via its automatic camera adjustment.

 Privacy is prioritized on the Portal TV. Don’t feel like using the camera or microphone? You can disable either of them or both of them. All calls are encrypted to prevent unauthorized access.

 The Portal TV offers additional services to you based on your subscription category.
