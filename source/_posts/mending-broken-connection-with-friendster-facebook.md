## Mending Broken Connection with Friendster (Facebook)

 Is Facebook randomly logging you out? If it does, it may happen for several reasons. Your account might be simultaneously logged in to another device, Facebook may have technical difficulties on its backend, or it might just be a browser glitch. Similarly, a problem with your Facebook account can also log you out unexpectedly.

 In this article, we will cover solutions that will help you stop Facebook from logging you out randomly.

## Preliminary Checks and Fixes

 You should first perform the following preliminary checks and fixes before moving on to major ones:

1. Ensure you don't have another Facebook profile open in your browser simultaneously.
2. Restart your browser or Facebook application.
3. If you have any VPN enabled on your mobile device or browser, disable it.
4. Make sure the Facebook app is updated.
5. Ensure your mobile device has enough storage.

 If the problem persists following the above checks and fixes, apply the following troubleshooting...

## 1\. Ensure Facebook Isn't Facing Technical Difficulties

 First, you should ensure that the issue isn't caused by a technical difficulty on Facebook's end. For that, go to [DownDetector's official website](https://downdetector.com/) and search for "Facebook" in the search bar in the top right of the screen.

 Look at the outage graph displayed on the website over the past 24 hours. If the reported issues are too high, Facebook might be experiencing technical issues. To confirm the outage, visit [Facebook's Twitter handle](https://twitter.com/facebook) and look for any announcements.

 If the problem comes from Facebook's backend, you can wait until it is resolved. However, if the problem only affects you, start applying the following fixes...

## 2\. Close Facebook on All Other Devices

 Facebook doesn't limit the number of devices you can log into your account simultaneously, and everything you do on one device gets automatically mirrored on the others. In some cases, however, being logged in on multiple devices may cause Facebook to log you out constantly. Thus, it's imperative to rule out this possibility.

 So, close Facebook on your other devices and check whether this fixes the problem. If Facebook stops logging you out after you close your account on other devices, it's a multiple login problem. Therefore, do not use your account on more than one device simultaneously.

 Nonetheless, if the issue persists after closing Facebook from other devices, move on to the next fix.

## 3\. Exit Suspicious Facebook Sessions

 If you logged into your Facebook account on a public device and didn't log out before leaving the computer, the session might still be active. Thus, logging out of such unknown sessions is necessary to ensure it stays open only on one device and gets logged out of others.

 To log out of a suspicious Facebook session on the website, follow the below steps:

1. Click on your profile icon in the top-right corner.
2. Go to**Settings & privacy > Settings** .

3. Go to**Security and login** .

4. To log out of a session active on an unknown device, click the**three vertical dots** next to it and hit**Log out** .

### Exit Suspicious Facebook Sessions on the Facebook App

1. Click on your profile icon in the top-right corner (on Android) or**three horizontal lines** in the bottom-right corner (on iOS).
2. Go to**Settings & privacy > Settings** .

## 4\. Ensure the Issue Isn't Account-Specific

 Once you are confident that multi-login isn't causing the issue, ensure the problem isn't with your Facebook account. To test your hypothesis, log in with a different account (create a new account if you don't have one already) and see how Facebook treats it.

 If Facebook doesn’t log you out when using a different account, the problem might rest with your account. You can test it further by logging in to the same account on another device and seeing whether Facebook behaves the same way.

 If it's an account-related issue, you can raise a support ticket with Facebook, as explained at the end of this article. However, if Facebook kicks you out of all of your accounts, the issue might be with your browser or third-party apps.

## 5\. Remove Facebook Sign-Ins From Third-Party Websites and Apps

 Have you recently signed up for a third-party website or app using your Facebook account and started experiencing this issue afterward? If so, this sign-in might be the cause. To exclude this possibility, you must remove recently linked apps and websites. For that, follow the below steps:

1. In the top-right corner, click on your profile icon.
2. Go to**Settings & privacy > Settings** .
3. Go to**Security and login** .  
![Opening Security and Login Settings in Facebook](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Image-4-Opening-Security-and-Login-Settings-in-Facebook.jpg)
4. In the left sidebar, click**Apps and websites** .

5. Click**Remove** right next to the app you'd like to unlink.

6. When the confirmation pop-up appears, click**Remove** again.

To remove linked apps on the Facebook app, follow the below steps:

1. Tap the menu icon in the bottom-right corner (on iOS) or top-right corner (on Android).
2. Navigate to**Settings & Privacy > Settings** .
3. Tap**Apps and websites** under**Security** .
4. Tap on the app or website you want to remove, then tap**Remove** in the next window.
5. When the confirmation pop-up appears, tap**Remove** again.

![Clicking on Apps and Websites Settings under Security Tab to Check Linked Apps in Settings of Facebook for iOS](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Clicking-on-Apps-and-Websites-Settings-under-Security-Tab-to-Check-Linked-Apps-in-Settings-of-Facebook-for-iOS.jpg)

Close

 If unlinking the apps and websites doesn't solve the problem, your browser might be to blame.

## 6\. Rule Out Browser Issues

 Before rolling up your sleeves and applying browser-related fixes, ensure the browser is actually causing the problem. To confirm this, switch the browser and run the same Facebook account there.

 If you keep getting logged out on other browsers, the problem is your account, not the browser. So, you can skip browser-related fixes. Nonetheless, if the browser switch allows you to access Facebook without being logged out, the problem lies with your browser.

 To fix issues with your browser logging you out repeatedly, apply the below fixes:

* Remove all extensions related to Facebook in your browser. We have an article about [removing extensions from your browser](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-clean-up-your-browser-extensions-the-easy-way/) ; if you don't know the process, you can check it out.
* Clear your browser's cache and cookies to ensure the accumulated data in the cache isn't interfering. If you're unfamiliar with the process, you can check out our guides that explain the [process of clearing cookies and cache in Edge](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-clear-microsoft-edge-cache-browsing-data/) ,[Chrome](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-clear-cookies-cache-in-chrome/) , and [Firefox](https://www.makeuseof.com/clear-cache-firefox/) .

### Clean the Cache of Your App

 For the same reason we cleared the cache on a browser to eliminate chances of cached data causing the problem, you should also clear your app cache. Check out our guide explaining [how to clear the app cache in Android](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/clear-cache-android/) and [iOS](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-clear-cache-on-iphone-ipad/) if you've never done so before.

## 7\. Report the Issue to Facebook Support

 When you've tried all other options to fix the issue at hand, and nothing seems to work, you should report the problem to Facebook. Here is how to do it:

1. Log into your account.
2. In the top-right corner, click on your profile icon.
3. Select**Help & support** from the menu.

4. Click on**Report a problem** .
