## Mobile Mastery: Fastest Android Compact Apps

 Lite versions of apps are developed by companies with some omitted features and improved performance. These versions are your best shot if you are struggling for storage space or have performance issues with your phone. Many people also choose lite versions because of the low data consumption of these apps.

 Here are the lite versions of some of the popular apps that are worth installing.

 Skype is a popular video calling app by Microsoft that requires no introduction. Skype Lite provides all the significant features of the main app but is lightweight, faster to download, and highly compatible with low-end phones.

 It offers voice and video calls, text chats, and even SMS integration. It is built with the latest Skype technology to perform well even under limited network speeds.

 Microsoft has optimized Skype Lite for cellular data saving as it adjusts the video quality according to the quality of your connection. It also has a great data usage tracking feature so that you won't burn through your allowance too quickly.

 If you are looking for a less resource-hungry version of the Facebook app, Facebook Lite is the way to go. It works well with slower networks and saves data. Facebook has developed Facebook Lite for phones that have less than 2GB of RAM, but the good thing is, its features are not too limited.
