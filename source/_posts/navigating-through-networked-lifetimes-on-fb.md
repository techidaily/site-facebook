### Key Takeaways

* Viewing your friendship history on Facebook lets you see common interests and interactions with friends through a button or URL.
* The URL method allows you to view tagged posts, events, photos, and videos between you and your friend.
* The tool only works with current Facebook friends due to privacy concerns, and there are general privacy risks associated with using Facebook.

 Did you know that a single button or URL lets you see your entire Facebook history with anyone you are friends with? You can see your interactions from when you first became friends, your shared interests, and more.

 Here's all you need to know about accessing your friendship history on Facebook.

## How to See Your Friendship History on Facebook

 By viewing your friendship history on Facebook, you'll see a list of things you have in common and photos or posts you're both tagged in. There are two ways to view your Facebook friendship history: through a button on the friend's page or a custom URL.

 Using the friendship history button on a profile is the easiest option. Here is how to use it:

1. Navigate to your friend's page on Facebook (either in the app or on the web).
2. Click the**three dots icon** near the message button.
3. Click**See Friendship** .

 Using the URL is a little more complicated, but still useful. Follow these steps:

1. Navigate to your profile and make a note of your username. You can find it in the URL. It is usually your first and last name followed by a number with dots in between instead of spaces.
2. Repeat the process for your friend.
3. In your browser's address bar, type**<www.facebook.com/friendship/\[username-1\]/\[username-2\]/>** , replacing the usernames as appropriate.
4. Press**Enter** .

 You should now be looking at a page that shows any posts, events, photos, and videos the two people are tagged in. At the top it will say,**You and \[Your Friend\]** .

 Remember that you can only use this tool with your current Facebook friends, not profiles you used to be friends with or profiles you never friended. Once you become friends on Facebook, the URL will work as long as you stay friends on the site.

## Can You See the Friendship Between Any Two People on Facebook?

 It used to be possible to see the friendship history between any two people, but Facebook removed this feature due to privacy concerns. And we recommend tweaking certain settings to [make your Facebook more secure](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-prevent-strangers-viewing-facebook-profile/) .

 Today, the URL still exists (indeed, it is used in this process), but you are restricted to seeing the history between yourself and your Facebook friends. And the addition of the**See Friendship** button makes it even easier.

 You can also see the friendship history between your account and memorialized accounts on Facebook.

## Is There a Privacy Risk to Viewing Your Facebook Friendships?

 Facebook is no stranger to privacy risks. Almost all users now accept that Facebook is harvesting their data. Yet it doesn't seem to dampen people's appetite for logging on. So, the risk of this tool is the same as using Facebook in general.

 Some other [common Facebook privacy risks](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/the-top-4-risks-you-face-when-you-use-facebook/) include insecure third-party apps, incorrectly configured privacy settings, Facebook Marketplace scams, predators, and even social media addiction itself. Only you can decide where this Facebook friendship history tool ranks in the list of threats. If you don't want someone using this tool on your Facebook profile, you should unfriend them.

 The friendship history tool is excellent for reminiscing about your past with someone. You can even use this to remember important dates, events, and the anniversaries of your Facebook friends. But if you don't want the tool used on your profile, it's best to stop being Facebook friends with the person in question.
