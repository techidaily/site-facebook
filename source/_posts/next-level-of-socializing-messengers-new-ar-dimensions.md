## Next Level of Socializing: Messenger’s New AR Dimensions

 You can now engage and catch up with loved ones in new, fun ways in Messenger. That's because Facebook has launched Group Effects, a feature that allows you to share augmented reality (AR) experiences with your friends on Messenger, allowing all participants to take part in the fun during a video call.

So, what are Group Effects all about? Keep reading to find out.

 Facebook Messenger has added Group Effects, a new feature that allows everyone on a video call to join in on the same AR experience at the same time, making video calls more engaging and fun.

 Group Effects adds layers to your video calls so you can express yourself in even more ways during a video chat with loved ones.

 Previously, you were only able to use AR effects on your own, like augmenting a photo or video for Stories or Reels. Now, you can enjoy a two-way AR experience with multiple people in a video call.

## How Facebook Messenger’s Group Effects Work ![Screenshot of messenger group effects effects on facebook blog](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-of-messenger-AR-effects.jpg)

 A huge shift from the platform's one-participant-at-a-time AR feature, the Group Effects feature allows you to play multiplayer games with your friends during a video call, so you can do more than just catch up.

 Messenger has a library of more than 70 Group Effects to choose from, including a game where you and your friends compete to build the best virtual burger.

 The effects are available now across Messenger video calls and Messenger Rooms (Facebook's Zoom copycat feature), with plans to launch on Instagram in the future.

 To start using Group Effects, open the Messenger app and**start a video call** or**create a room** . Tap the**smiley face icon** , and then select**Group Effects** . Now choose from the range of effects to start playing.

## Facebook Is Adding Dimension to Messenger Video Calls

 Facebook is adding more creative ways to communicate and catch up with others, thereby breaking the monotony that sometimes comes with phone or video conversations.

 In addition to helping you to connect with your friends and family on Messenger, Group Effects will allow you to do that in fun and memorable ways, adding dimension to your video calls.

 This is important as many people rely on video calls to feel closer to their loved ones, especially when seeing them in person is not an option.
