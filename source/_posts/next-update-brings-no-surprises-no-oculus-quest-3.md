## Next Update Brings No Surprises, No Oculus Quest 3

 Despite the Oculus Quest 2 only releasing at the back end of 2020, gamers seem to still be expecting an Oculus 3 or Pro in 2021\. Well, don't hold your breath, because Facebook has put paid to any rumors of a new Oculus in the works.

## There Won't Be an Oculus Pro in 2021

 In a recent Twitter Spaces Q&A (transcribed by [Upload VR](https://uploadvr.com/facebook-oculus-quest-pro/) ), Andrew Bosworth, Oculus Vice President, said:

> People are also asking about the Quest 3, which doesn’t exist yet, and everyone who is listening to us who is a reporter there isn’t a Quest 3, there’s only a Quest 2...

 You can't really get much clearer than that. For now, the focus is on the Oculus Quest 2 (and the Quest 1, to a degree). Given that [Facebook has only just revealed the Air Link connectivity for Quest 2](https://www.makeuseof.com/oculus-quest-2-wireless-air-link/) , it makes sense that the most recent iteration of the VR platform is Facebook's focus.

## Will There Ever Be an Oculus Quest 3?

 This is where things get interesting. Yes, Bosworth has denied that there is a Quest 3 or Quest Pro in development for a 2021 release. However, he also said:

> I did hint at an AMA earlier this year about Quest Pro because we do have a lot of things in development where we want to introduce new functionality to the headset along the kinds that people theorize that we would want to introduce, and that’s a little ways off still. It’s still not gonna happen this year.

 So, we won't be getting a Quest 3 or Pro**this year** , but Facebook is constantly working on developing extra features for the platform. If you want to experience VR, though, Quest 2 is the way to go. The Oculus VP says:

> For those who are curious, Quest 2 is going to be in the market for a while—for a long while, and it’s gonna be, you know, I think the best bet for the most accessible way to get into VR and have a great experience.

 We can expect the Oculus Quest 2 to be around for some time before we see any hint of an Oculus 3 or Pro model.

## Will You Be Investing in the Oculus Ecosystem?

 You have to admit, it is a very exciting time for VR platforms, and Oculus is no exception (especially with the recent announcement that Resident Evil 4 will be coming to the platform as a first person VR exclusive title).

 If you're considering buying into the Oculus experience, then now is the time to do so. It is an easy-access platform, which is the perfect way for anyone to experience VR for the first time.
