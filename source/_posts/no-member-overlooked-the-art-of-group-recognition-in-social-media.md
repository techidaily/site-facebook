## No Member Overlooked: The Art of Group Recognition in Social Media

 So, your Facebook Group's gotten large, but you still struggle with getting members to actually see new posts. One great way to draw more attention to your posts is by tagging members in them.

 Tagging or mentioning each member individually can be time-consuming, if not outright impossible. Fortunately, Facebook has an easy solution. You can now tag all of your group members in one postâ€”and it only takes a few steps.

## How Does the Facebook Group Mention Feature Works?

 Before we dive into the steps, let's look at how the group mention feature works. Previously, if you wanted to mention a group member in a post, you had to type the user's name. This could be tedious and time-consuming, especially in large groups with hundreds of members.

 The group mention feature allows you to quickly mention all the members in your Facebook Group with one click. This means that each member receives a notification of the post, and can join in the conversation if they wish.

## How to Tag All Your Group Members in a Facebook Post

 If you want to tag all your group members in a post, here's how you do it:

Close

1. Create a Group post, like you normally would.
2. Type in the**@** symbol and click on**@everyone** right in the post or in a new comment after posting.
3. All group members will be notified of the mention.

 That's it. This simple method will ensure that everyone in your group is aware of any new posts or updates, and allows them to engage with it as they please. You shouldn't use this for [boosting Facebook group engagement](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-engage-facebook-group-members/) , rather saving this form of mentioning for important notices. Facebook restricts the use of the @everyone tag to once daily, so you won't be spamming your group with notifications.

## Using the @everyone Tag Responsibly

 The group mention feature is a nifty tool, but should be used sparingly and responsibly. Too many notifications can overwhelm members and lead to irritation or cause them to leave the group altogether.

 When used correctly, the group mention feature can help keep your group engaged and informed. Just be sure to use the group mention feature only when necessary and be considerate of your members.
