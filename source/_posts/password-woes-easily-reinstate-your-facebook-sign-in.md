## Password Woes? Easily Reinstate Your Facebook Sign-In

 Can't log in to your Facebook account because you forgot your password? Relax, take a deep breath, and don't panic.

 First off, you're not alone. Many people often forget their passwords.

 Secondly, you can reset your password to regain access to your Facebook account. We'll show you how to in this article...

## Before You Reset: Check Your Browser's Password Manager

 Before you reset your password, it's worth checking whether you have it stored on your phone or computer.

 Most browsers will prompt you to autosave your passwords when logging into online accounts. So you should check whether your browser saved your Facebook password.

Here's how to check in Chrome on your Android device.

Close

1. Tap the Chrome menu button and go to **Settings > Passwords** .
2. Enter**Facebook** in the Password search bar, or manually check for Facebook in the list of sites shown.
3. Tap on Facebook.
4. Then tap the eye icon.
5. Unlock with PIN or fingerprint to view your saved password.

 If you didn't find your Facebook login details in your saved passwords, you will need to reset your password to regain access to your account.

## Reset Your Facebook Password

 Resetting your Facebook password should be a breeze if you have previously added an email address and an alternate phone number (different from the one you use for two-factor authentication).

Here's what to do to reset your password:

2. Click**Forgotten password** ?
3. Enter your mobile number or email address in the Find Your Account box.

 Facebook will search for accounts associated with the details you entered.

1. Select how you want to receive your reset code and click**Continue** .
2. Enter the security code sent to you via text or email and click**Continue** .

If you didn't get the reset code, do the following.

1. Wait for a few seconds and click**Didn't get a code?**
2. Select how you want to receive your code.
3. Ensure that your phone is on and that the message inbox isn't full.
4. Check your email spam folder if using email.
5. Whitelist Facebook so that you don't miss future emails.

 Note that you will be unable to reset your password if you have reached your daily password reset request limit.

 In that case, you'll have to wait for 24 hours before you can try again.
