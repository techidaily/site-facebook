## Privacy Concerns: When Will FB Messaging Go E2EE?

 Facebook Messenger is easy to use and has great features. Moreover, you can use the service from both your phone and your computer. But some users may find the lack of default end-to-end encryption concerning.

 As such, many people are wondering when the service will offer end-to-end encryption by default. This article will reveal the answer, along with discussing why it's not already in place.

## When Will Facebook Messenger Offer End-to-End Encryption?

 Facebook has announced plans to [bring default end-to-end encryption to Messenger](https://www.makeuseof.com/facebook-messenger-instagram-direct-chats-wont-encrypted-until-2022/) .

 This was outlined in an April 2021 post on the [Facebook Newsroom](https://about.fb.com/news/2021/04/messenger-policy-workshop-future-of-private-messaging/) by Messenger’s Policy Director, Gail Kent.

 However, Kent added that the work was a long-term project. At the earliest, users should expect the feature to be released in 2022.

 One thing all Facebook users can attest to is how easy Messenger is to access; you can easily log into your account from any device with an internet connection. Facebook even allows you to log into your account on multiple devices simultaneously.

 Another perk of Messenger is how your chats are synced across every device you use. But this can’t be said of the [messaging platforms that offer default end-to-end encryption](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-the-top-instant-messaging-services-use-end-to-end-encryption/) .

 You can only access most of these from with one device at a time, and all old messages are lost when there’s a device switch, unless the chats were backed up. And in that case, they’re no longer end-to-end encrypted.

 Facebook’s drive to keep the platform easily accessible is why it is yet to offer end-to-end encryption by default on Messenger.

## Should You Be Worried About the Privacy of Your Messenger Chats?

 Normally, you don't need to worry too much about the privacy of your conversations on Messenger. And if you want to send and receive encrypted messages, you could use the Secret Conversations feature.

 But if you’d rather use a messaging platform that offers default end-to-end encryption, plenty of alternatives exist. So why not give them a try and see how you like them.
