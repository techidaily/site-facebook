## Proclaim Your Trustworthiness with Meta US

 Meta has expanded its verification subscription, Meta Verified, into the United States. The rollout allows creators and other users interested in paid verification to sign up for the service.

## Meta Launches in the US

 Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg made the announcement that Meta Verified is rolling out in the US on his Instagram broadcast channel on 17 March 2023\. The company also provided an updated statement on the [Meta Newsroom](https://about.fb.com/news/2023/02/testing-meta-verified-to-help-creators/) .

 Meta Verified is technically still in its testing phase, with its initial launch in February 2023 making the subscription available in Australia and New Zealand. According to Meta, the expanded rollout is due to positive results from its initial launch.

In its press release, the company noted:

> "We’re expanding our test of Meta Verified to the US after seeing good results from our early testing. This test in the US will reflect some initial learnings and feedback."

 While increased reach was initially included as one of the [features of Meta Verified](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-meta-verified-is-it-worth-the-money/) , the company says it is removing it for now as the company gathers more feedback. The feature was likely inspired by a [Twitter Blue](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-twitter-blue/) feature that ranks verified users higher in conversations.

> "We’re exploring elements to add to the subscription as we roll out to more places and will share more when we’re ready."

 Zuckerberg also shared a link where users can find out more about the service:[meta.com/verified](https://meta.com/verified) . For those who are waiting for the subscription to roll out out to their country, the option to join a waitlist is also available on the resource website.

 If Meta is available to you, you can sign up on either Facebook or Instagram. Simply go to**Settings** , select**Accounts Center** , and then click on the**Meta Verified** option. According to Meta, if the subscription is available for your account, you will see the text "**Meta Verified available** " under your name.

## Meta Verified Seems to Be Here to Stay

 While some raised eyebrows when the news of Meta Verified was first announced, Meta appears to be forging ahead with the subscription plan. However, with changes to its features already happening, it may look a lot different in the future.
