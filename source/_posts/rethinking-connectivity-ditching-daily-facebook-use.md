## Rethinking Connectivity: Ditching Daily Facebook Use

 When we talk about breaks, most people confuse it with the conventional art of taking breaks from work or family, but some people also need to take a break from social media, at least for a while.

 How can something designed for entertainment become frustrating? Believe it or not, apps like Facebook can be pretty addictive, which leads to people feeling unwanted burdens and stress. You could also just find that the platform has become tiresome.

 The only solution is to take a break and leave Facebook for a while. Here is a guide to everything you need to know about taking a break from Facebook.

## Temporarily Deactivating Your Facebook Account: How It Works

 Deactivating a Facebook account means that it becomes inactive and unavailable for use. As opposed to deleting your account, deactivation is temporary so can be used to take a break from the platform.

 During the deactivation process, Facebook requests an estimated time for when you wish to come back. Choose the time you have in mind, or leave it to manual reactivation. There is no limit to how often you deactivate and activate your Facebook account. Similarly, you can also keep it deactivated for as long as you wish. Your account won’t be re-activated unless you do it yourself.

 Facebook also gives users the option to log out instead of complete deactivation, but you will receive email notifications, and people can find and tag you in Facebook content. This is not a recommended practice, especially for those wanting a break from Facebook. Users who plan to take a permanent break by account deletion can log back within 30 days to stop the process.

 In addition, the following things happen when you deactivate your Facebook account...

### No Visibility

 Your account is no longer visible to other users—even if they search for it. Having no visibility means that people won't be able to connect with you, share posts or mention you in their comments on Facebook.

 Once your account has been deactivated, the platform does not let others[tag you in their Facebook photos](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/3-things-you-need-to-know-about-photo-tagging-in-facebook/) . Some people deactivate their Facebook account for privacy.

### No Notifications

 If you deactivate your Facebook account, you won’t be receiving Facebook notifications anymore.

 You can even opt out of or adjust receiving email notifications for a deactivated account. This gives you time to relax and relieves the stress of opening the app every now and then.

### Adjusted Messages and Comments

 After the deactivation of your account, your comments will be visible on Facebook but with plain text and a default icon. No one will be able to open your profile and send you messages.

 Since Facebook is connected to Messenger (a separate app), your contacts will still be able to send you messages and calls. You don’t want that either? You can[deactivate your Messenger account](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/deactivate-facebook-messenger/) as well.
