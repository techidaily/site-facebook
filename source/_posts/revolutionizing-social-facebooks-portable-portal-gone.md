## Revolutionizing Social: Facebook's Portable Portal Gone

 Facebook is taking its Portal line in a different direction. The social networking giant recently unveiled the new Facebook Portal Go.

 We'll take a look at the new product and how it differs from other devices in the Portal family.

 Portal Go brings the usual smart camera experience but with a unique twist. Thanks to a built-in battery, the device can be taken from room to room in a home during a Zoom video call or anything else.

 There's even a built-in handle to help make the device easier to hold.

 The device sports a 10-inch screen and a 12-megapixel camera with an ultrawide field of view. That will help keep the person talking in view at all times.

 And even when you're not on a video call, the Portal Go has a wide variety of other features. It offers Amazon's Alexa built so you can check the weather, play a song, and more with a simple voice command.

## A New Way to Use Facebook Portal

 The new Facebook Portal Go provides a unique way to enjoy the social network's video chat-focused hardware. The built-in battery and ability to move between rooms in your house makes it stand out in a sea of other smart speakers with a touchscreen and cameras.
