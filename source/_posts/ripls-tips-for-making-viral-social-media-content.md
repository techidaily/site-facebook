## Ripl's Tips for Making Viral Social Media Content

 If you're a social media enthusiast, you'll know that images and videos have a much higher potential for engagement than text-only posts. However, you might think that creating these posts requires extensive technical design skills. With apps like Ripl, though, you can create spectacular graphics for your feed—without the hassle of attending design school.

 Today, we'll show you how to use Ripl to create social media posts that stand out from the rest of the crowd.

## What Is Ripl?

[Ripl](https://www.ripl.com/) is an app designed to make engaging visuals for social media. The key feature of Ripl is its massive library of templates, stock images, and videos. It's available now for Android devices, iOS devices, and as a web app.

 One of Ripl's strengths is its intuitive editor that enables the customization of templates through colors, fonts, and animations. And the app's drag-and-drop image editing feature makes graphic design easier.

 Ripl costs $14.99/month, but you can save 33% if you opt for an annual subscription. Signing up to the platform requires a credit card, but you can bypass this requirement if you prefer. Unfortunately, that means you won't be able to download anything you create.

**Download** : Ripl for [Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU2000374/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ripl.android&hl=en%5FUS&gl=US) |[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ripl-social-videos-posts/id1030906799) (Subscription required, free trial available)

## Getting Started With Ripl ![Image showing the home page of Ripl app](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Ripl-for-SM-Contents-05.jpg)
