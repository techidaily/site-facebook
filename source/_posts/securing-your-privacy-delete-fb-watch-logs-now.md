## Why You Should Delete Your Facebook Watch History

 You might be wondering why you should bother deleting your Facebook watch history. After all, it's just a record of what you watched, right? Well, not exactly. Your Facebook watch history reveals a lot about your interests, preferences, habits, and opinions. And this information is accessible at a glance to anyone who happens to[check your Facebook watch history](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-find-recently-watched-videos-facebook) on your device.

 It's also possible that the Facebook algorithm will use your watch history to recommend other videos to you. If you have, for any reason, watched videos that don't align with your interests, you may want to remove them from your watch history to avoid similar recommendations.

 If you're torn between clearing your watch history and keeping it for reference purposes, you can use the "Save video" feature instead. Your saved videos won't be affected when you clear your watch history. And, frankly, it's easier to find a video you'd like to refer to from your saved videos than from the Activity log.

 Whether you should clear your Facebook watch history is a personal decision that comes down to your individual needs. If privacy and control are paramount, clearing your watch history is a good way to manage your digital footprint. If you value relevant recommendations and convenient access to past videos, keeping your history might be more beneficial.
