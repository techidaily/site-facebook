## Should You Harness Facebook's Power for Your Events? Here's Why Not

 Facebook has evolved into a hub for businesses and online activities. Events by Facebook is one of the many features available on this app. It allows you to organize and create upcoming events, post updates, and include directions, amongst other details.

 You can promote any occasion to a global audience with the right tools and techniques. But is this feature really worth it? Here, we’ll answer whether you should use Facebook Events and discuss its pros and cons.

## The Pros of Using Facebook Events

 Let's start with the advantages of using Facebook Events as an event manager, shall we?

### 1\. Easy to Make Events ![PMI hosts in-person and virtual events to keep members abreast with what is happening in the industry.](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Networking-event.jpeg)

 A standard non-digital invitation includes different steps and requires you to spend a lot of time designing and bringing the idea to life. There is so much to look at, from choosing your text to font and picking color combinations and address lists.

 Unlike your conventional event planners, Facebook Events does not require all that. The person hosting the event has complete control over what should be included, how they can make it interesting for the audience, and what special considerations will make people like it.

 We recommend creating your own [Facebook page for branding](http://www.makeuseof.com/why-facebook-page-is-better-for-branding/) if you are in the events organizing business or gathering community, as it is a much better option than using a personal profile.

### 2\. Better Visibility

 A Facebook Event is accessible by anyone who looks for it. This platform is a great way to engage users. People can share it on their Timeline, so others can see and join if interested.

 This gives Facebook Events better visibility than your standard ones that are only recognized by people who see the poster or ad. Facebook has billions of users, enabling you to reach out to a high-end market providing more chances of people showing up.

 Although there are a lot of active users, people who genuinely respond are going to be within your area or share the same interests. This is why you need to have a dynamic and engaging circle.

### 3\. Understand the Audience's Needs ![facebook-user-types](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/facebook-user-types.jpg)

 Having an event that does not spark the target audience's interest is useless. You cannot understand what the people want by just sending out invites. With Facebook Events, it is possible to hear the voice of people who plan to join you.

 Users can see a discussion tab within the event that lets people post and talk about their expectations related to the big day. Unless there is no need for a discussion (for instance, in work-related events), the creator can keep the tabs open for the audience.

 Talking to the audience about their requirements and expectations gives you a chance to make adjustments that make everyone happy.

### 4\. Constant Reminders in News Feed

 When you create an event on Facebook, it automatically appears in the News Feed of your friend list. Any engagement or impressions constantly make it reappear on the feed. This is kind of an automatic reminder without any effort.

 It automatically builds interest when you occasionally see the same event with more discussion and hype. Many people interact with it because of the comments and its constant appearance.

### 5\. Brand Building Made Easy ![Brand building on Facebook](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Brand-building-on-Facebook.jpg)

 For most people, it’s their job to create and organize events. If you are from a similar field, Facebook provides an opportunity to start your own thing and attract people using the events feature.

 With minimum investment, you have the opportunity to gain success. However, it is your job to make things more believable and personalized to attract a crowd.

### 6\. Accessible Sharing ![Share events in a group](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Share-events-in-a-group.jpg)

 Facebook Events are more powerful than word of mouth. Users can share their favorite occasions with several people on their Timeline and other platforms like Whatsapp. This is an indirect promotion and a chance to get more people to attend the event.

 Note that people can only share events with [privacy settings adjusted to the public](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-manage-facebook-privacy-settings-for-specific-posts/) . Private events are only popular among a selected group of audience.

## The Cons of Using Facebook Events

 Although Facebook Events has a ton of positives, it's far from perfect. Below, we've listed a few limitations of this feature.

### 1\. Excessive Requests

 Since the creator has the authority to invite people, most of them go a bit too overboard with the requests. This includes constantly sending them requests to check out the event or sharing it repeatedly. Hence, it appears on others’ feeds, which can irritate the people who genuinely want to attend the event.

 Avoid sending out extra requests or invites to people you have formal contact with. Facebook automatically sends reminders, so creators doing the same can be a bit too excessive.

### 2\. Extra Event Notifications ![Facebook notifications](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Facebook-notifications.jpg)

 We are all looking for an event that gets the hype it deserves. However, when people start interacting with the creator and the event, it can get annoying to cope with the notifications. If you don't want to respond to them, simply [disable the Facebook notifications](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-delete-facebook-notifications/) .

### 3\. Lack of Privacy

 Anyone can search for the current events to become a part of them. You never know there might be a crook or dangerous person interested in your event. Hence, lack of privacy can be a serious concern for people trying to host something private.

## Should You Use Facebook Events?

 Facebook Events is a facility provided to people so they can increase the exposure of their events. It lets you create online invites for a group of people or the general public.

 The feature enables you to understand audience requirements and gain engagement. But as you've seen, there are some limitations, like too many notifications and lack of privacy.

 Overall, Facebook Events can help people create trending and popular events without much expense if used correctly. It is suitable if most of your audience uses Facebook or knows how to interact with the app.

## Invite People Through Facebook Events

 It is possible to create successful Facebook Events and even build a business out of them with adequate knowledge and understanding. However, we expect the users to remain cautious and consider the requirements of their target audience before launching an event to gain maximum response. Also, it is essential to take care of your privacy before creating a public presence.
