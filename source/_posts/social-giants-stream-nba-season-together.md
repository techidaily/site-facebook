## Social Giants Stream NBA Season Together

 The WNBA's 25th season isn't exactly going to be tough to find online---with the Women's National Basketball Association announcing that its games will stream on a plethora of platforms, including Twitter, Facebook, and the streaming service Paramount+.

 Twelve of the league's games will be airing on Twitter, along with real-time game highlights and post-game interviews. Meanwhile, Facebook will be streaming a total of 20 WNBA games on its[video-on-demand service Facebook Watch](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/facebook-watch-youtube-netflix-amazon-prime/) and its Oculus Quest and Quest 2 VR headsets, while three games will be available to view on Paramount+.

## Hitting All the Platforms

 This is in addition to 100 national telecasts that will play out on the likes of ABC, ESPN, ESPN2, CBS Television Network, CBS Sports Network, and NBA TV. For details on everything happening this season, including where each game is available for viewing, you can check out the official[WNBA Schedule](https://www.wnba.com/schedule/) .

 For those who want to watch everything, the $17 WNBA League Pass offers access to all 110 games this season.

 "Providing significant opportunities to view WNBA games across traditional and streaming platforms drives expanded coverage to our growing fan base," said WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert[in a statement](https://www.wnba.com/news/wnba-announces-broadcast-and-streaming-schedule-for-leagues-25th-regular-season/) . "Our goal is to deliver as many WNBA games and content to our passionate fans and supporters across platforms that best match the evolution of content consumption."

 The league has additionally announced a partnership with Google as its latest WNBA "Changemaker." The new season will commence May 14.
