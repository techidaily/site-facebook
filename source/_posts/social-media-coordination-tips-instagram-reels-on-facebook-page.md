## Social Media Coordination Tips: Instagram Reels on Facebook Page

 Have you ever wanted to share an Instagram Reel with your Facebook friends and followers? Good news! You can do this, and it's relatively simple. For those seeking to boost exposure or ensure family members see their content, sharing Reels from Instagram to Facebook is a fantastic option.

 Let's explore how you can share Instagram Reels to Facebook both before and after posting. But first, you'll need to link your Facebook and Instagram accounts.

## How to Link Facebook and Instagram

 Sharing your Instagram Reels on Facebook is an excellent way to leverage both platforms' audiences, especially since Instagram's Reels feature has become so vital. Meta has also introduced the option to [create Reels on Facebook](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-create-reels-facebook/) .

 However, you may prefer to share your current or future Instagram content as Reels on Facebook, rather than navigating the new creation tools and starting from scratch on the platform.

 You'll need to ensure that your Facebook is linked to your Instagram.[The Account Center is a hub introduced by Meta](http://www.makeuseof.com/facebook-instagram-account-center-linked-accounts/) to enhance the integration between Facebook and Instagram.

To link your accounts, follow these steps:
