## Social Media Demystified: Utilizing Facebook's Transparency Hub Features

 Facebook wants to be clearer about its policies to help you better understand the app, and has launched a new resource to help in this respect.

 Facebook's Transparency Center is a one-stop shop for anyone looking to understand how the platform deals with all manners of things.

 This article will help you navigate the Transparency Center so you can understand the social media network better.

## What Is Facebook’s Transparency Center?

 Facebook's Transparency Center is a hub for all of Facebook's policies—a single destination for all information relating to its integrity and transparency efforts.

 It is designed to provide more insight on its policies. Facebook has been criticized by many for a perceived lack of transparency, especially around policies affecting users’ online rights.

 Advocates are concerned about how the company uses and shares users’ information, how it polices and manages users’ speech, and how it regulates information on its platform.

 The Policies tab explains Facebook's community standards. It talks about how the company tackles violent and criminal behavior, objectionable content (such as hate speech, sexual content, and nudity), respecting intellectual property, and more.

 You can also read up on other policies such as advertising policies, along with content related to WhatsApp and Instagram.

### Enforcement

 This section helps you understand how Facebook enforces all of its policies. It details how the company detects, reviews, and takes action against violations, with the help of both its employees and technology.

 The company claims that its reviewers sift through and act on "millions of pieces of content" every day, with the aim of removing, reducing and informing.

## Facebook Is Working on Transparency. But Is It Enough?

 It's clear that Facebook is trying to do something about the years-long criticism it has received in relation to transparency.

 While its Transparency Center is a step in the right direction, the tech giant still has a long way to go. It'll take a lot more than a single resource center to instil trust in its users, critics, and the relevant authorities.
