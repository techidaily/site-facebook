## Social Media Giant Introduces Enhanced Auditory Services

 You can now find all of Facebook's audio formats in one dedicated section on Facebook's News Feed. It's called Audio, and it is, rather confusingly, located inside the Watch tab.

 Facebook is rolling out a new Audio hub, which will house audio content such as podcasts and Live Audio Rooms. This will make it easier to find all audio content offered on Facebook, and help you keep up with the latest content from your favorite creators' channels.

 Keep reading to find out all about Facebook's new Audio hub, including how you can find it and use it.

## What Is Facebook’s New Audio Hub?

 Facebook's Audio hub is a new section on Facebook which is dedicated entirely to audio content. The hub houses all audio content in one place, making it easier and quicker for you to access audio content while online.

 The audio content types you can find in the new hub includes short-form audio, podcasts, as well as Live Audio Rooms. Facebook has officially launched the hub after having rolled out an early version to Facebook users over the age of 18 in the US.

 The Audio hub is available to all Facebook users using iOS and Android devices. At launch, the Audio hub is only available to mobile users, with plans to expand it to desktop users in the future.

 You can find the new Audio hub in**the Watch tab** on Facebook's News Feed, just above Stories. Simply tap the type of audio you want to listen to and start exploring.

 The strategic positioning of the new Audio hub will enable content creators' shows to be more discoverable, which will help creators to gain more visibility across Facebook. It will also help Facebook users to discover new audio content from their favorite creators.

 For now, you can expect to see content from the creators you’re following, as well as recommendations from Facebook based on what other users are listening to at the time.

 With time, however, you can expect to see more personalized recommendations as Facebook learns what kind of content you like based on the audio content you engage with.

## Audio Content Is Gaining Popularity on Social Media

 Social media is changing. No longer are images the most important type of content on social media platforms, but audio content is increasingly becoming more popular—with the likes of audio rooms gaining prominence.

 It's no surprise, then, that Facebook is focusing on audio content by giving it a dedicated space on its platform, making it easier for users to find and engage with this type of content.
