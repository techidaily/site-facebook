## Soundscapes in Speeches: The Rise of Facebook's Soundemojis

 There are different ways of expressing yourself on Facebook Messenger. You can call, via audio or video, sent plain text messages, audio messages, or even use emojis, GIFs, and stickers to convey a message.

 In addition to that, you can also now use Soundmojis—emojis with sound—which makes chatting even better. This article will explain what Soundmojis are, how Soundmojis work, and how to use them in Facebook Messenger.

## What Is a Soundmoji in Facebook Messenger?

 A Soundmoji is an emoji that is paired with sound effects and sound bites. Created by Facebook, Soundmojis present an even better way of expressing yourself.

 No doubt, emojis are always handy when you want to express something in the most precise way without struggling with words. Facebook has paired different classic emojis that you already know and use with an appropriate sound to create Soundmojis.

 As it turns out, and as you probably know, emojis are hot right now. According to Facebook, over 2.4 billion messages are sent per day with emojis via Facebook Messenger.

## How Do Soundmojis Work?

 Soundmojis work in a straightforward way. You take an emoji then pair it with an appropriate sound. For instance, the clapping emoji is paired with a clapping sound.

 But in addition to that, some Soundmojis are paired with audio clips from different artists and popular movies and TV shows like Brooklyn Nine-Nine from NBC and Universal Television, and Bridgerton, a Netflix Original.

 For instance, the checkmark emoji plays Ariana Grande’s “Thank You Next” lyric, while the fist bump emoji plays "I don't have friends, I got family" from Fast and Furious 7.
