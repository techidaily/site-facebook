## Stealth Mode for Your Social Media Pics

 There are many reasons you should make your photos private on Facebook. Aside from privacy concerns, the site is also teeming with unscrupulous scammers who want to take advantage of other people on the platform.

 To deal with this issue, Facebook has customizable settings that allow you to restrict access to your photos or hide your photos from others. You can set some to be viewable only by your friends or make them completely private and only viewable to you.

 Here's all you need to know about how to make photos private on Facebook.

## How to Make Your Facebook Photos Private

 To make photos private on Facebook, you can change the privacy settings of entire albums or individual photos.

### How to Make Albums Private on Facebook for Android and iOS

 You can change the privacy of an entire album on Facebook to save time, rather than needing to make photos private one by one.

 However, you should remember that you can only edit the audience of your photos—not pictures that your friends uploaded. For the latter, you can [untag yourself from a Facebook photo](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-untag-yourself-on-facebook/) or ask your friend to delete it.

 To make a photo album private on Facebook's Android or iOS app, follow these steps:

1. From your profile, scroll down until you see the**Photos** button. Tap it to view your Facebook photos.
2. Then, find the photos you want to make private under**Albums** .
3. Go to the relevant album, then click the**three dots** in the top right corner.
4. Select**Edit** or**Edit album** . You'll see a section that says**Friends** or**Public.** Click that to change the audience of your album.
5. From here, you can control who can view the album. Select**Only Me** if you do not want anyone else but you to see this album and make it private.
6. On the Facebook Android app, tap the**back arrow** and click**Done** . If you're on iOS, tap**Done** in the top right and then select**Save** . This will hide all photos in your Facebook album.

 If you don't want to make the photos completely private and still want to share them, just with a more limited audience, you can choose the audience options for**Friends** ,**Friends except** , or**Specific friends** .

### How to Make Individual Facebook Photos Private on Android and iOS

 You can also change the privacy of individual photos on Facebook to make them private.

 It's important to remember that you can only change the privacy settings of certain photos inside some groups or albums. These include:

* Photos of you
* Uploads
* Profile photos
* Cover photos
* Timeline photos
* Mobile photos

 Photos uploaded in batches along with others and as part of an album will follow the settings of the album.

To make a single photo on Facebook private, follow these steps:

## Who Can See My Photos on Facebook? How to Check

 If you want to double-check the privacy of your photos, you can view your public profile on Facebook. This is the profile that people who aren't your friends can see.

 To do this, you'll use the**View As** feature on Facebook. You can access it on both the Facebook website and the app.

 To enter this mode, go to your profile. Select the**three dots** below**Edit profile** (on the Web) or next to**Edit profile** (on mobile) to open a dropdown or pop-up menu, then select**View As** .

![View as on Facebook.com](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/view-as-option-facebook-website.jpg)

 This will show you all the previous posts that people outside your Facebook friends list and the platform can see. You can not change the [privacy settings of your Facebook you're](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/facebook-photo-privacy-settings-need-know/) while you’re in the View As mode, but you can take note of the photos and the dates so that you can find them later.

 Once you know which photos you want to set to private, leave View As public mode by clicking on your thumbnail in the top right corner of your screen or clicking back. Alternatively, tap**Exit View As** . On mobile, tap the**X** button at the top to exit View As mode.

## How to Hide Photos on Facebook From the Public in the Future

 The next time you post a photo, the privacy settings will automatically follow the last settings you set for a photo if you don't have a default option set. So, if you set a previous photo to Only Me, it will be the default audience setting of the next photo you upload.

 To change the audience settings of the photo you are about to upload, click on the**audience settings button** . You will find it below your name.

 From here, you can change the post audience and even select a default option. First, select your preferred option. If you want the setting to apply to all future posts, tap to enable**Set as default audience** , then tap**Save** to return to your post. Otherwise, tap**Done** . When you want to share the photo, select**Post** .

 If you don't set a default audience option, always check this button before you upload or post anything on Facebook. You should do this just to make sure you are not accidentally sharing photos or information with people outside the platform and your friends list.

 Also, regularly check your profile in View As mode to see if you may have accidentally shared anything with the public.

 Having a [Facebook privacy and security checklist](https://www.makeuseof.com/facebook-privacy-and-security-checklist/) that you go through regularly will help make sure you catch any of these photos right away. Remember that the longer these photos are shared publicly on social media, the higher the chances of a scammer getting a hold of them. Although this helps, you can [make your Facebook private](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-make-facebook-private/) if you need more security.

## Now You Know How to Hide Photos on Facebook

 Reviewing your social media accounts and changing the audience settings of your photos to private is a good cyber hygiene practice. It will not only protect your data but will also protect the privacy of your loved ones who may be in the pictures you upload.

 Always remember that there are unscrupulous hackers and scammers who are looking for ways to take advantage of other people.
