2. In the**Menu** , scroll down and tap on**Groups** .
3. You'll get to a screen which will show you groups that are recommended to you based on the groups you follow, and you'll be able to view Your Groups from the top tabs.

5. Tap it and select**Create Group** .

## Customize Your Facebook Group

 Before you create your group, you'll need to select some options from a menu which will enable you to customize it for your purposes.

 You'll be taken to a page where you will have to fill out the name of your group and the privacy option. If you select**Public** , anyone can see who's in the group and what they post. If you select**Private** , only members of the group can see the activity of the group.

 The next option to choose from is whether the group is**Hidden** or**Visible** . Anyone can find Visible groups, but only members can find Hidden groups.

 When you're finished, click**Create Group** at the bottom of the screen. You'll then be taken to a page that will allow you to invite members from your Facebook friends.
