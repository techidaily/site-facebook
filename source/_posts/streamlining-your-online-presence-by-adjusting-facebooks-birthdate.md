## Streamlining Your Online Presence by Adjusting Facebook's Birthdate

 Waking up to a ton of warm birthday wishes from your Facebook friends can be a great feeling. But that's only when the day is actually your birthday.

 Getting birthday wishes on a day that's not your birthday is something everybody with a wrong birthdate on their Facebook profile has experienced–or should expect to experience soon.

 If you've ever received greetings from your Facebook friends on a date that wasn't your birthday, this article is for you. We'll show you how to change your Facebook birthday to avoid those wishes coming on the wrong date.

## What You Need to Know Before Changing Your Birthday on Facebook

 Before we go into the steps to changing your birthday on Facebook, let us cover some preliminary information.

 First off, you can only change your Facebook birthday once in two weeks. If you have recently changed yours, you may need to wait for some time before changing it.

 Also, you can only change your birthday three times. Well, maybe more, but you'll have to send a request for the fourth time, and Facebook staff will make the change for you.

## How to Change Your Birthday on the Facebook App

Follow the steps below to edit your birthday on the Facebook app.

2. Tap on**Edit Profile** .
3. Scroll down and tap**Edit Your About Info** .
4. Tap**Edit** in the**Basic Info** section.
5. Make your desired corrections.
6. Check the confirmation box, scroll down, and tap**Save** .

## How to Change Your Facebook Birthday on the Web

Here's how:

* Log on to [Facebook.com](https://www.facebook.com/) on your browser, sign in, and navigate to your profile. You can get to your profile by clicking on your name on the left sidebar or clicking on the icon with your photo on the page header.

## How to Request a Birthday Change to Facebook

 If you've changed your birthdate more than three times, you can still do so. But this time, you'll have to send a request to Facebook to change it for you. Here's how to do that:

* Click on the**contact us** link in the notification telling you that you've used up all your birthday changes.

![contact facebook](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/contact-facebook.JPG)

* Input your desired changes.
* Select a reason for the change in the dropdown menu and click send.

 Facebook will then correct the error in your birthdate as soon as your request is processed.

## Get Your Birthday Wishes on the Right Day

 Follow the steps we've outlined above to edit your birthday on Facebook. That way, you no longer have to worry about getting birthday wishes on a day that isn't your birthday.

 One other importance of having accurate information, like birthdays, on your Facebook account is that they sometimes require government-issued IDs that show your actual birthday when retrieving an account. So if the birthdate on your ID and on the social media platform doesn't match up, you might lose your account permanently.
