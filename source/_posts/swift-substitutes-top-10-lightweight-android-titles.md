## Swift Substitutes: Top 10 Lightweight Android Titles

 Lite versions of apps are developed by companies with some omitted features and improved performance. These versions are your best shot if you are struggling for storage space or have performance issues with your phone. Many people also choose lite versions because of the low data consumption of these apps.

 Here are the lite versions of some of the popular apps that are worth installing.

## 1\. Skype Lite ![Skype Lite - Home](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Skype-Lite---Home.png)

 Skype is a popular video calling app by Microsoft that requires no introduction. Skype Lite provides all the significant features of the main app but is lightweight, faster to download, and highly compatible with low-end phones.

 It offers voice and video calls, text chats, and even SMS integration. It is built with the latest Skype technology to perform well even under limited network speeds.

 Microsoft has optimized Skype Lite for cellular data saving as it adjusts the video quality according to the quality of your connection. It also has a great data usage tracking feature so that you won't burn through your allowance too quickly.

## 2\. Facebook Lite ![Facebook Lite - Main](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Facebook-Lite---Main.png)

 If you are looking for a less resource-hungry version of the Facebook app, Facebook Lite is the way to go. It works well with slower networks and saves data. Facebook has developed Facebook Lite for phones that have less than 2GB of RAM, but the good thing is, its features are not too limited.

 RELATED:[What Is Facebook Lite and Can It Replace Facebook?](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/facebook-lite-worthy-facebook-replacement/)

 It is fast and works well even on 2G and 3G networks. You can check your news feed, profile, stories, videos, news, and even marketplace on this Lite version.

 However, you will have to compromise on some features, such as Facebook Live. It is evident that an app almost 100 times smaller in size than its standard counterpart can't have the same feature set.

 It has all the significant features of Instagram, such as the ability to add photos, support for direct messages, and even IGTV.

 Parallel Space is a cloning app for Android through which you can use multiple app accounts on the same device simultaneously.

 It supports all the features such as multiple accounts and secret space. However, the highly optimized app doesn't affect your phone's space and performance.

The Lite version lacks the incognito feature of Parallel Space.
