## Tailored Content Streaming Through Page Management

 Facebook allows users to like a page, follow it, or do both at once. Liking a page demonstrates your support for it, but you won't see the content posted by the page admin in your feed. If you follow a page, Facebook will show you posts, events, and other activities posted from that page in your news feed.

 Those who don't want to see the content of any particular page in their feed can unfollow it. We'll show you different ways to unfollow a Facebook page on the web and your mobile device.

## How to Unfollow a Facebook Page on the Web

[Facebook's "Suggested for You" content](https://www.makeuseof.com/facebook-suggested-for-you-explained/) and other suggestions are directly influenced by the type of pages you follow. Therefore, it is imperative to keep the list of liked pages clean. The Facebook website offers four main ways to unfollow a page. Some are convenient for unfollowing a single page, while others are helpful for unfollowing pages in bulk.

### 1\. Unfollow a Facebook Page From Your News Feed

 The quickest way to unfollow a Facebook page is directly from your news feed. When you see a post from a page you no longer want to receive updates from, this method comes in handy.

 To unfollow a Facebook page from your news feed, click the**three horizontal dots** in the post's top-right corner and click**Unfollow <pagename>** from the context menu.

### 2\. Unfollow a Facebook Page Directly From the Page

 Unfollowing a page directly from the page itself is another option you have at your disposal. This method is suitable if you know the page's name and want to unfollow it directly.

Here's how to unfollow a Facebook page using this method:

1. Use the search box at the top-left to search the page by name.
2. Open the page once it appears in the search results.
3. If you see the**Following** button, click it to open the**Follow settings** window. If you don't see it, click on the**three horizontal dots** below the Search button and select**Following** .
4. In the**Follow settings** window, check the circle next to**Unfollow** .
5. Finally, click**Update** .

### 3\. Unfollow Facebook Pages From the Pages Tab

 If you want to unfollow multiple pages simultaneously, unfollowing them from the Pages tab is a great option. To unfollow Facebook pages in bulk: first select the**Pages** tab on the left. If you don't see it, expand the**See More** menu and select the**Pages** tab.

Now:

1. Navigate to**Liked Pages** on the left.
2. In the**All Pages You Like or Follow** section, you'll see a list of all the pages you currently follow or like.
3. Locate the page you want to unfollow.
4. Tap on the**Following** button to unfollow it.
5. Alternatively, click the**three horizontal dots** below a page to open the**Follow settings** window.

Follow the same procedure for all the pages you want to unfollow.

### 4\. Unfollow Facebook Pages From Your Feed Preferences

 This method also allows you to unfollow pages in bulk to [clean up your Facebook account](https://www.makeuseof.com/ways-to-clean-up-facebook-account/) . However, compared to the above, unfollowing several pages at once is faster with this method. Follow these steps to unfollow pages using this method: first, click your**profile icon** in the top right corner. Go to**Settings and Privacy** and select**Feed** to open the**Manage Your Feed** window.

 Select**Pages Only** from the sort menu in the top right to see only the pages you follow. Click the**Following icon** next to the pages you want to unfollow.
