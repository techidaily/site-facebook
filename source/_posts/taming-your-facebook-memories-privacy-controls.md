## Taming Your Facebook Memories: Privacy Controls

 Facebook is a virtual diary of most of the things that happen in your life, and the Facebook Memories feature automatically prompts you to look back at past events on any particular date.But that can mean reliving painful memories tooâ€”which some people aren't thrilled with. If you don't want to be reminded of certain events or memories, here's how to stop Facebook from showing them.

## What Are Facebook Memories?

 Facebook Memories is actually a pretty cool feature, and 90% of the time, it's a great way to take a look at your social life. It will find who you made friends with in years past, and it will show you goofy photos from that epic party two years ago. Facebook pushes these as notifications in your news feed.

 But you have to remember that this is a machine generating all those moments. It can't feel, and it can't understand emotions, so it's going to make mistakes. Your past is a part of who you are today. And often, there is some baggage that you have learned to deal with and live with, but you might not want to be reminded of it suddenly. Unfortunately, that's what Facebook Memories does.

 Journalist Julia MacFarlane, for instance, got an unpleasant reminder of one of the scarring experiences in her life:

 Renowned web developer Eric Meyer went through a horrible year after his daughter died. He didn't want to recap the pain. But Facebook sent him a popup notification in his timeline that showed his daughter's face surrounded by illustrations of dancing people and balloons. Meyer[wrote on his blog](http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2014/12/24/inadvertent-algorithmic-cruelty/) :

> Those of us who lived through the death of loved ones, or spent extended time in the hospital, or were hit by divorce or losing a job or any one of a hundred crises, we might not want another look at this past year. To show me Rebecca's face and say "Here's what your year looked like!" is jarring. It feels wrong, and coming from an actual person, it would be wrong. Coming from code, it's just unfortunate. These are hard, hard problems. It isn't easy to programmatically figure out if a picture has a ton of Likes because it's hilarious, astounding, or heartbreaking.

 As Meyer pointed out, there is an algorithm failing here, but there is also a human failing. The human failing was that Facebook pushed this to users without giving them a way to opt-out. But the social site has since introduced ways to do this.

## How to Block People in Facebook's 'On This Day'
