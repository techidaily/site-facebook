## The Day Without Likes and Messages

 Facebook's entire network of online properties went offline for around 7 hours on October 5th 2021\. But how did this happen and why did it appear Facebook had completely vanished? In this podcast, we take a look at the events leading up to Facebook's unscheduled downtime. This includes some theories surrounding the event and the surrounding storm instigated by whistle-blower Frances Haugen.
