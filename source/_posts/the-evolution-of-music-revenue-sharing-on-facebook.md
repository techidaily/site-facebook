## The Evolution of Music Revenue Sharing on Facebook

 Social media has many positive aspects, like its opportunities to earn an income. In fact, it is so lucrative that some creators quit their jobs to focus on content creation full-time. Social media companies are increasingly improving their platforms to help creators make even more money.

 An example is Facebook, which has introduced a music revenue-sharing program for its creators. Continue reading to find out what Facebook's music revenue-sharing program is about and how it works.

## What Is Facebook’s Music Revenue-Sharing Program?

 Facebook's music revenue-sharing program is a first-of-its-kind initiative that shares ad revenue with creators that use licensed music in their videos. The program was announced in a [Meta blog post](https://web.facebook.com/creators/music-revenue-sharing?%5Frdc=1&%5Frdr) in July 2022 as follows:

> Today, we're introducing music revenue sharing on Facebook, making it easier for video creators to monetise their videos that use licensed music from our expansive catalogue. This gives both creators and music rights holders a new way to earn money from videos on Facebook.

 This is another way for Facebook creators to earn money on the platform. In May 2022,[Meta improved monetization opportunities for Reels creators](https://www.makeuseof.com/meta-help-creators-make-money-reels/) . One of the ways it did this is by incentivizing Reels creators to post original content consistently.

 But it's not the only platform motivating creators to post original content.[Instagram announced it would start rewarding original content](https://www.makeuseof.com/instagram-rewarding-original-content/) as well. Of course, the new music revenue-sharing program is yet another way [Facebook is positioning its platform to compete with TikTok](https://www.makeuseof.com/can-reels-solve-the-tiktok-problem-for-facebook/) .

 However, this time, Facebook is focused on long-form content instead of short-form video.

## How Facebook’s Music Revenue-Sharing Program Works

 Creators get to keep 20% of the revenue generated from videos containing tracks from Facebook's licensed music library. The library includes music from artists like rapper Post Malone, singer Leah Kate, and more.

 The program is open to creators that qualify for in-stream ads and meet [Facebook's Partner Monetization Policy](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/169845596919485?id=2520940424820218&%5Frdc=1&%5Frdr) . This is a guideline for best practices if you want to earn money on the platform.

 To qualify for Facebook's music revenue-sharing program, creators must post videos at least a minute long that contain a visual element. Only videos uploaded to a Facebook page qualify.
