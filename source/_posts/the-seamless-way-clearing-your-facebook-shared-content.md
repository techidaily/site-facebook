## The Seamless Way: Clearing Your Facebook Shared Content

 It's happened to all of us. We post a story on Facebook, and then moments later, we regret it. Maybe we shared something that we shouldn't have, or maybe we just changed our minds about wanting the world to see our story.

 Whatever the reason, Facebook gives you the ability to delete your stories before they automatically delete after 24 hours. In this article, we will walk you through the process of deleting your Facebook stories.

## How to Remove Your Story on Facebook

 Facebook allows you to delete your story on its app and web versions. This guide will cover both versions so that you can delete your story regardless of how you are accessing Facebook.

### Get Rid of a Story on the Facebook Android App

To delete your story on the mobile version of Facebook:

3. Tap the**vertical ellipsis** to reveal options.
4. Select**Delete video** or**Delete photo** , as the case may apply.
5. Tap**Delete** on the confirmation prompt.

And there you have it.

## Can You Recover a Deleted Story on Facebook?

 Unlike what happens when you [delete a Facebook post](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-delete-facebook-posts/) , you cannot recover a deleted story. So, if you delete your story by mistake, you will have to re-upload it as Facebook does not give users the ability to recover deleted stories.

## Removing Your Facebook Story Is Easy

 Deleting your story on Facebook is a simple process that can be done on both the app and web versions of the site. Just remember that once you delete your story, it's gone for good. There is no way to recover a deleted story on Facebook.
