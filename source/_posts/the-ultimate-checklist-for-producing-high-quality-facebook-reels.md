 Meta introduced Reels to Instagram in 2020 to take on TikTok, which was soaring in popularity at the time. Reels work similarly to [how TikTok videos work](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/what-is-tiktok-how-does-it-work/) . They are usually between 15 and 60 seconds long and edited with audio or various effects.

 The feature surged in popularity and quickly became the platform's fastest-growing content format by a wide margin. This, in turn, encouraged Facebook to launch Reels on its platform in February 2022.

## How to Create a Reel on Facebook

 Creating a Reel on Facebook is easy once you know how. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Launch the Facebook app on your device.
2. Tap on**Reels** right above your**Stories** to switch to the Reels tab.
3. Tap on the**Create Reel panel** to create a new Reel.
4. You can either choose to capture footage directly in the app, or select videos and photos from your camera roll.
5. Once you've selected your content, it's time to edit. You can add effects, filters, and music to your Reel.

## Recording Your First Facebook Reel Video

 If you're filming directly in the app, you'll see a few options on the right side of your screen.

 The first is**Add music** . Here, you can choose to add a soundtrack to your Reel from Facebook's library of licensed songs. There's also**length** , where you can choose how long you want your Reel to be. The maximum length is 60 seconds.

 Then there's**Speed** . This is where you can choose to speed up or slow down your video.**Effects** is where you can add fun filters to your Reel. Next is**Timer** , which lets you choose how long you want the camera to run before it starts recording.

 And last but not least, there's**Green screen** . This is a fun effect that lets you change the background of your video.

 Once you're happy with your settings, it's time to record! Tap on the**Record button** and start filming. When you're done, tap on the**Next button** to go to the edit page.

## Editing Your Facebook Reel Video ![Facebook Reel recording page](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Facebook-Reel-recording-page.jpg)

 The edit page is where you can really bring your Reel to life. Here, you can edit clips and add stickers, text, and music (if you've not already) to your video. You'll find the Edit options on the right side, like on the recording page.

 When you're done, tap on the**Next button** . You'll be taken to the Share page. Here, you can add a caption and choose who you want to share your Reel with. You also get to choose whether you want to**Enable remixing** for your Reels, which means other people can use your video to create their own videos.
