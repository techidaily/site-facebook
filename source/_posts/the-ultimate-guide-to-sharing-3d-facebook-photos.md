## Tips for the Best 3D Picture

 You can select any photo you want to create your 3D picture for Facebook. However, there are a few guidelines and tips you should be aware of to create the best results:

* Don’t edit your photo. If you edit your photo you may not be able to post it as a 3D photo.
* Only share one photo. If you share multiple photos at once the option to create a 3D photo will not appear.
* Avoid images with narrow objects as the focus or with a reflection.
* Due to the way the technology extrapolates what the area behind the subject looks like, try to avoid busy backgrounds or backgrounds that closely match your subject.

## Possible Issues With Creating a 3D Picture on Facebook

 If you are experiencing issues creating and posting a 3D photo to Facebook and you have reviewed and followed the tips provided in this article, there are a few things you can try to get the feature working.

Things you should try include:

* Ensure your Facebook app is up-to-date and you have restarted the app.
* Ensure your operating system for your device is up-to-date. You may also want to restart your phone.
* If you are trying to post your 3D picture to a Page you must be an admin or editor.
