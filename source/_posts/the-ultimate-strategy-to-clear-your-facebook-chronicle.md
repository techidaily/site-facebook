## The Ultimate Strategy to Clear Your Facebook Chronicle

 It's happened to all of us. We post a story on Facebook, and then moments later, we regret it. Maybe we shared something that we shouldn't have, or maybe we just changed our minds about wanting the world to see our story.

 Whatever the reason, Facebook gives you the ability to delete your stories before they automatically delete after 24 hours. In this article, we will walk you through the process of deleting your Facebook stories.

## How to Remove Your Story on Facebook

 Facebook allows you to delete your story on its app and web versions. This guide will cover both versions so that you can delete your story regardless of how you are accessing Facebook.

### Get Rid of a Story on the Facebook Android App
