## Together Through Technology: 7 Platforms for Social Solidarity

 Social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook were created to universally connect us. These applications are an excellent way to meet new people and reconnect with old friends.

 While it's well known that social media platforms can divide us, it has also given us an opportunity to make connections with others. Making the world a much smaller place.

Here are the ways that social media brings people together...

## 1\. Keeping in Touch With Friends and Family ![a group of friends on a beach](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/enjoy-non-fitness-focused-activity-on-rest-day-such-as-socialising.jpg)

 Many people around the world experience loneliness. It may be because you are newly single, widowed, have moved away from family and friends for work—or you may just be shy and uncomfortable with in-person interaction.

 Thankfully, social media allows us to connect with anyone, at any time.

 It's a great way to reconnect with people you have lost touch with and keep in contact with your loved ones. Check out our guide on [stopping strangers from seeing your Facebook](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-prevent-strangers-viewing-facebook-profile/) if you want to up your privacy settings.

## 2\. Maintaining Long-Distance Relationships ![Screenshot of Facebook Messenger chat window](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-Facebook-Messenger-Chat-1.jpg)

 Sometimes, life keeps couples physically apart from one another. But through social media, you and your partner can stay connected without needing to constantly chat.

 You can look through each other's photos and reminisce, then connect via Messenger chat. Facebook's Messenger application also has a video call option available when you want some face-to-face time.

To use Facebook Messenger's video call feature:

1. Open Messenger.
2. In the search box at the top, search for the person you wish to chat with.
3. Click on their conversation and press the**video camera icon** .

 Long-distance relationships are easier to maintain than ever with the help of social media. If you and your partner are separated by distance, never fear: Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter are here.

## 3\. Sharing Pictures With Your Family and Friends ![Woman scrolling Instagram feed](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/instagram-feed.jpg)

 Many families live away from each other and this can be very difficult for everyone involved. Grandparents, especially, have a difficult time being away from their grandchildren. But social media is an easy way to stay connected even when you're far apart.

 Sharing photos to your Instagram account is a great way for your family to feel like they are involved in your everyday activities. The platform lets you share as many photos as you like and it's easy to use even for beginners. You can add artistic filters to your photos, tag people in them, and privately chat via their message application.

 Instagram can be used on your phone or computer. If you want to make a new post on Instagram, follow the tips in this article detailing [how to post on Instagram from your PC or Mac](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-post-on-instagram-from-pc-mac/) . Your family will enjoy seeing what you're up to every day!

## 4\. Connecting Through Facebook Groups

 Social media has given us the amazing ability to connect with people on the internet and turn them into friends. Many strong bonds have been forged through shared hobbies and interests.

 Facebook lets you search for and join various groups and communities where you can chat, post questions, and engage with other people. There are groups available for physical illnesses, mental health diagnoses, television shows, and places of employment.

 If you are feeling lonely, joining a Facebook group is a perfect way to meet people who share the same interests as you.

### How to Join Groups on Facebook ![Screenshot of Facebook group search](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-Facebook-Groups-Search.jpg)

To join a group on Facebook, follow these steps:

1. Go to the search bar at the top of your Facebook homepage.
2. Type in a topic.
3. **Select the "Group" option** at the top of your screen.
4. When you find a group you want to join, press the**"+Join"** button. Some groups may ask qualifying questions to see if you're right for the group, answer them, and click submit.

Then, wait for your request to be approved and start connecting!

 Remember to protect your personal safety: you should never volunteer information about yourself online. If anyone you meet in a Facebook group asks you for your personal information, be sure to report it to the group's administrator.

 Facebook groups are an excellent way to make friends and business connections. After all, a stranger is just a friend you haven't met yet.

## 5\. Joining Social Media Movements ![People protesting in public](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Web3-Protests-Against-Jack-Dorsey-Tweet.jpg)

 Social media has brought many of us closer together. One of the major ways people are uniting is via social media movements like the "Me Too" movement against sexual harassment and assault, which is one of the many [Twitter hashtags that have shaped history](https://www.makeuseof.com/twitter-hashtags-that-shaped-history/) .

 People who have experienced these terrible crimes have come together to tell their stories and stand up against the exploitation of vulnerable people.

 The birthplace of many social media movements is on Twitter. People use hashtags such as #metoo to unite all the posts in one place and tell their stories. Hashtags have brought attention to many injustices in the world and have also bonded people together in times of tragedy.

## 6\. Meeting New People ![Group of friends taking a selfie on a sunny day](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/why-a-sense-of-belonging-is-vital-for-your-wellbeing-and-how-to-find-it-online.jpg)

 We spoke earlier about how social media helps you connect with your existing loved ones, but platforms like Instagram and Twitter are also excellent for meeting new people with similar interests. For example, if you have a hobby like photography, you could potentially make lifelong friends by meeting these people in real life and going for regular photoshoots.

 Sports fans can similarly use social media networks to meet fans of the same or different teams, and even watch games together. The more niche your interests are, the better social media is for helping you find like-minded people. Consider trying these great [social media apps for making friends in your community](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-social-media-apps-for-making-friends/) if you're looking to build your network.

## 7\. Helping People Reunite With Others and Items ![A person holding their phone with Twitter feed on display](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/a-person-holding-a-silver-iphone-6.jpg)

 In addition to raising awareness for important global issues, social media is also powerful in potentially dangerous situations. For example, some people have used Facebook and Twitter to share details of missing people or pets—which has allowed others to inform the original poster if they see or know something.

 Similarly, social media is useful for reuniting people with items that they might have lost—such as their house keys or wallet.

## Social Media Can Be a Positive Influence

 These are just a few of the many ways that social media connects us all in our daily lives. Because when you open yourself up to the idea of making friends online, the possibilities for connecting are endless.

 Sure, many people will condemn social media for being a negative influence on our lives—but it's up to us to use social media as a force for good rather than bad.
