## Top 10 Changes to Maximize Your Fb App'ease and Effectiveness

## 1\. Customize Your Facebook Shortcut Bar

 Whether you want to remove the red notification dots from the bar or the Marketplace shortcut, you can do so from the settings. Go to**Settings & Privacy > Settings > Shortcuts,** and here you can customize both the**Shortcut Bar** and**Notifications Dots** .

## 2\. Adjust the Video Quality and Autoplay Options

 When you install the Facebook app, video autoplay is turned on by default. As the name suggests, this feature automatically plays a video when you scroll through your feed.

 Autoplay has its advantages in terms of avoiding video buffering. Still, it won’t suit you if you are on a metered network because it will consume your mobile data relatively quickly. You can turn this feature off by going to **Settings & Privacy > Settings > Preferences > Media** and checking the**Never Autoplay Videos** option.

 And while you are at it, you can also adjust the video quality in this menu to further optimize your experience on the app. There are multiple ways to do this.

 First, you can check**Optimized** to let the app adjust video quality according to your network. And if you want to save even more data, you can turn on the**Data Saver** feature. You can also change the video quality for individual videos by adjusting the resolution while playing them in your feed.

## 3\. Get a Report to See Your Time on Facebook

 You can turn this feature on or off by going to **Settings & Privacy > Settings > Permissions > Upload Contacts** .
