## Top 10: The Risks of Befriending Unknowns Online

 Facebook has become a communication hub for people worldwide, and all types of people use this app and have the liberty to reach out to you.

 You may consider socializing, but who knows what the person on the other end is aspiring to achieve by becoming friends with you.

 Safety should be your top priority when using social media. We have compiled a detailed article on why you shouldn't add strangers on Facebook.

## 1\. Risk of Identity Theft ![Man showing an image](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Man-showing-an-image.jpg)

 We upload multiple posts, photos, and pictures on Facebook. As a matter of fact, some people share their entire life with their friends. With so much information on your profile, it gives people a chance to collect your data.

 When someone collects personal data and uses it for their own benefits, it's called identity theft. This is how scammers and internet thieves steal your identity online.

 It becomes hard to accuse one person of committing a crime with unknown people in the profile. You can bypass these scams by avoiding anonymous requests or people you don't trust.

## 2\. Impairment of the Privacy of Your Friends ![Man checking others on Facebook](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Man-checking-others-on-Facebook.jpg)

 Our loved ones, acquaintances, and friends on our Facebook profiles choose to trust us with their content. However, they might have different opinions about adding unknowns.

 Accepting requests from strangers not just gives them access to your content but also to specific information about your friends. Consider a situation where you and your friends tag each other in pictures, check-ins, and stories.

 This allows them to access all this information. It might create long-term problems and a series of trust issues if something wrong happens because of your habit of giving access to anyone.

## 3\. Access to Harmful Links

 Over the years, people have exploited Facebook to hack accounts into other people's personal space. Everyone is aware of [phishing and hacking scams](https://www.makeuseof.com/types-of-phishing-attack/) , and for that reason, befriending unknown people might be pretty risky.

 They can send you harmful links through Messenger or post them on your timeline. Most people click them out of their naivety and curiosity and give their personal information to the so-called friend.

 Unless the links you receive are from people you know, there is no point in clicking them.

## 4\. Personal Safety at Risk

 Facebook has [launched many new features](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-facebook-features-other-apps-launched-first/) to keep users engaged. Most people get addicted to these features and update almost every activity.

 Becoming friends with strangers allows them to see things like your office, home, shopping hauls, and vacations if you upload their images. If someone dangerous likes what they see, your possessions and finances can come at a risk.

 Consistently updating locations on the map has led to multiple robbery and stalking crimes. If you only keep trustworthy people in your profile, it will eliminate the risk of getting stalked, mugged, or robbed from home.

## 5\. Become Habitual of Isolation From Family ![Using Facebook on smartphone](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Using-Facebook-on-smartphone.jpg)

 Talking to strangers online can be fascinating, especially if you get in touch with some nice ones. This simple app can become your whole life.

 People who talk to strangers can suffer from isolation, meaning they are glued to the screen all day instead of meeting new people. Addiction to online socialization reduces your confidence level and willingness to maintain good physical and mental health.

 Most people who become used to online chats lack the confidence to express themselves in front of others. Always take time to interact with people you know in real life to stop this risky contact with unknown people.

## 6\. Lack of Common Things

 Adding your loved ones on Facebook means that you have mutual interests or relations. This creates a fun and engaging environment where everyone feels safe.

 On the contrary, the strangers you add might not share the same interests as you. This lack of everyday stuff increases your friend list while reducing the engagement rate.

 Lack of engagement on your Facebook profile gives the impression of being dull and not an exciting person.

## 7\. Risk of Emotional Damage ![Man in emotional stress](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Man-in-emotional-stress.jpg)

 When you talk to people who know you in real life, there is an emotional connection and bonding. However, this is not the case with short-term online relations. These people are just there for fun or scams.

 When online ties have a heavy influence on you, it becomes tough to share things with people in real life. Lack of communication with families and loved ones might leave you feeling emotionally drained and damaged.

 Sometimes it is possible to find genuine people on Facebook who care for you, but you never know who that is.

## 8\. Possibility of Communication Gap

 Even if you become friends with unknown people on Facebook, there is a noticeable lack of communication. This communication gap results in temporary friendships and no mutual respect for one another.

 You never know when the other person will get rude or stop respecting you, so it's better to stay away from strangers on Facebook.

## 9\. Chances of Addiction

[Social media addiction is a real thing](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-social-media-addiction/) . It can be so distracting that you might waste a lot of time. Once you add strangers on Facebook, they try to chat and interact with you.

 This can be a highly destructive activity that keeps you away from completing daily tasks. Even if you give your trustworthy online friends time, it is essential to maintain a balance between online and real-life relations.

## 10\. Increased Chances of Getting Scammed

 When you add unknown people, they might try to scam you for money and other personal belongings. This is also an emerging [Facebook marketplace scam](https://www.makeuseof.com/facebook-marketplace-scams-and-how-to-avoid-them/) .

 Even if you add people on Facebook, be very hesitant to share your money and other resources.

## Avoiding Strangers on Facebook Might Be a Good Idea

 Facebook is the most popular platform of all time. It allows you to interact with others and make friends online. Sometimes, interacting with strangers and adding them to your profile might not be as good as it sounds. Other than getting your personal space invaded, there is also a possibility of getting scammed.

 Strangers can also hack your personal information like address, location, and pictures. People can become addicted to using social media, which results in damaged physical and mental health. Hence, you should avoid adding strangers unless they come from a trustworthy source.
