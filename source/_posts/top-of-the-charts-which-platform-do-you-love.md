## Top of the Charts: Which Platform Do You Love?

 There are people who don’t use any social media, but the majority of us use multiple social platforms every day. Social media helps us stay connected with the people we know, as well as foster communities of those with similar interests. Every social media platform has its perks, but do you have a favorite?

## Instagram: Sharing Pictures

 For sharing snapshots of your life, Instagram is the best social media app. There are other social media platforms that let you share photos, but none do it quite like Instagram.

 Since the platform launched, new features beyond basic photo sharing have been added. Now, you can record video Reels and share daily snippets through Stories. But at its core,[Instagram is the best platform](https://www.makeuseof.com/reasons-why-instagram-best-social-media-app/) for people who want a picturesque scrapbook of their life.

## Twitter: Sharing Thoughts ![3D Twitter app icon design-1](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/3d-twitter-app-icon-design-1.jpg)

 Barring any changes that happen to Twitter under Elon Musk's ownership, the platform is a great place to share your thoughts. You can share photos, links, and videos along with your thoughts, and employ [different methods to create longer tweets](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/tools-writing-longer-tweets/) if you need more room to get your point across.

 The current character limit for a single tweet is 280, which is perfect for summing up your thoughts in a few easily readable sentences. However, Twitter’s character limit may increase to 4,000 under Musk’s direction—at least [for Twitter Blue subscribers](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-twitter-blue/) .

## TikTok: Short-Form Videos

 TikTok lets you upload videos ranging in length from 15 seconds to 10 minutes, though most videos never reach the [10-minute maximum that feels too long](https://www.makeuseof.com/10-minute-videos-tiktok-too-long/) . Despite that higher maximum length, TikTok brought back the energy of 6-second Vine videos many of us seemed to miss.

 The platform is entirely dedicated to videos, and there are so many niche categories to explore, like BookTok or SportTok.

## Snapchat: Super Social ![3D SnapChat app icon design-1](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/3d-snapchat-app-icon-design-1.jpg)

 While you can have a public Snapchat profile, many people use this social media platform as a way to stay social with friends only. Sending a quick picture—either directly to a friend or to your story—is a great way to update people on what you’re doing without actually having to write out what you’re doing.

## Which Social Media Platform Is Your Favorite?

 Personally, Instagram is the platform I find myself mindlessly scrolling on every day, so I’m inclined to say it’s my favorite. That said, I usually browse Twitter and Snapchat every day, and hop on TikTok every other day—though often I’ll see TikTok videos on Instagram.

 There are way too many social media platforms to list in detail here, so feel free to choose the “Other” option and let us know in the comments which platform is your favorite! A few choice options not listed include Pinterest, BeReal, Tumblr, Reddit, and Mastodon.
