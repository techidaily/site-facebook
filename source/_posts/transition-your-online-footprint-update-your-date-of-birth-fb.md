 If you've ever received greetings from your Facebook friends on a date that wasn't your birthday, this article is for you. We'll show you how to change your Facebook birthday to avoid those wishes coming on the wrong date.

 Facebook will then correct the error in your birthdate as soon as your request is processed.

## Get Your Birthday Wishes on the Right Day

 Follow the steps we've outlined above to edit your birthday on Facebook. That way, you no longer have to worry about getting birthday wishes on a day that isn't your birthday.

 One other importance of having accurate information, like birthdays, on your Facebook account is that they sometimes require government-issued IDs that show your actual birthday when retrieving an account. So if the birthdate on your ID and on the social media platform doesn't match up, you might lose your account permanently.
