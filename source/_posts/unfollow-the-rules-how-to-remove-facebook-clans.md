## Unfollow the Rules: How to Remove Facebook Clans

 A Facebook group is a great way to share information with your friends and followers. However, there may come a time when you want to delete your group.

If you are ready to say goodbye to it, this article will help you.

 Here's what you need to know about how to delete a Facebook group on your mobile and desktop.

## What You Need to Know Before Deleting Your Facebook Group

 A group can have multiple admins, however, only the original creator can delete it. The only way you can delete a group you didn’t create is when the original creator chooses to leave it.

 Also, deleting a group is a permanent action, meaning you can’t get your group back once it's deleted. If you’re overwhelmed with managing posts and new members, but would still like to keep the group, you may want to "pause" the group instead.

 Facebook provides a pause option for admins who are overwhelmed with[managing posts and member requests](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-facebook-moderation-tools-to-manage-groups/) in their group. When you pause a group, new posts, comments, and reactions will be paused for all members, including admins.

 To notify members, Facebook displays a message at the top of the group, letting them know that activity on the group has been paused. This is so they’re not left in the dark as to why they can’t create new posts or make comments.

 That being said, if you’d rather pause your group, here’s how:

## Can I Archive My Group Instead?

 Facebook used to allow admins who needed a break from managing their groups to archive it. When a Group is archived, members can’t make new posts, comment, or react to existing posts: they’ll only be able to view already published content.

 However, Facebook has removed the archive group option. If you need a break from your group, you’ll have to choose between pausing or permanently deleting the group.

## What Happens When You Delete a Facebook Group?

 Deleting a group is a permanent action that can’t be reversed. Once you remove every member and yourself from the group, Facebook instantly deletes all posts, files, comments, and reactions shared in the group.

 Be sure you want to delete the group before going this far because at this point there’s no going back.
