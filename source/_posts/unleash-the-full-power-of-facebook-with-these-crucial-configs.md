## Unleash the Full Power of Facebook with These Crucial Configs

 Facebook updates its smartphone app regularly to incorporate new features and improvements. However, it can be challenging to keep track of the changelog.

 The Facebook app has a lot of settings that can potentially enhance your user experience, but some of them are somewhat hidden. So, let’s explore some of the most useful Facebook app settings worth changing.

## 1\. Customize Your Facebook Shortcut Bar ![Settings Highlighted Under Settings and Privacy in the Facebook App](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Settings-Highlighted-Under-Settings-and-Privacy-in-the-Facebook-App.jpg)

Close

 When you open your Facebook app, youwill see a shortcut bar at the top with links to Home, Watch, Marketplace, and others. You can [customize this Facebook shortcut bar](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-add-remove-shortcuts-facebook/) according to your preferences.

 Whether you want to remove the red notification dots from the bar or the Marketplace shortcut, you can do so from the settings. Go to**Settings & Privacy > Settings > Shortcuts,** and here you can customize both the**Shortcut Bar** and**Notifications Dots** .

## 2\. Adjust the Video Quality and Autoplay Options ![Media Settings Highlighted in the Facebook App](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Media-Settings-Highlighted-in-the-Facebook-App.jpg)

Close

 When you install the Facebook app, video autoplay is turned on by default. As the name suggests, this feature automatically plays a video when you scroll through your feed.

 Autoplay has its advantages in terms of avoiding video buffering. Still, it won’t suit you if you are on a metered network because it will consume your mobile data relatively quickly. You can turn this feature off by going to **Settings & Privacy > Settings > Preferences > Media** and checking the**Never Autoplay Videos** option.

 And while you are at it, you can also adjust the video quality in this menu to further optimize your experience on the app. There are multiple ways to do this.

 First, you can check**Optimized** to let the app adjust video quality according to your network. And if you want to save even more data, you can turn on the**Data Saver** feature. You can also change the video quality for individual videos by adjusting the resolution while playing them in your feed.

## 3\. Get a Report to See Your Time on Facebook ![Your Time on Facebook Option Highlighted in the Facebook App Settings](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Your-Time-on-Facebook-Option-Highlighted-in-the-Facebook-App-Settings.jpg)

 Facebook allows you to [review your screen time on the Facebook app](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/time-spent-facebook-instagram/) , which helps you manage your usage routine and habits. You can get a weekly report to see how you spend your time on Facebook and view your activity log, such as your posts, comments, and reactions.

 To access the screen time report, go to **Settings & Privacy > Settings > Preferences > Your Time on Facebook > See Your Time** . Here you’ll see an app usage graph, and you can toggle on the**Weekly Update** option to receive automated weekly updates.

## 4\. Turn On the Quiet Mode and Daily Time Reminders ![Your Time on Facebook Option Highlighted in the Facebook App Settings](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Your-Time-on-Facebook-Option-Highlighted-in-the-Facebook-App-Settings.jpg)

 Facebook has so much content available that it keeps you scrolling endlessly. And once you start exploring the app, it can be challenging to keep track of time. The Facebook app has a feature called Quiet Mode to address this issue.

 Quiet Mode mutes the notifications from the Facebook app, preventing it from distracting you during that specific period. You can schedule Quiet Mode according to your preferences.

 To access this feature, go to **Settings & Privacy > Settings > Preferences > Your Time on Facebook > Manage Your Time** .

 In the same menu, you can also choose the amount of time you want to spend on Facebook through Daily Time Reminder. As the name suggests, this feature sends you a reminder once you have used the app for the specified duration.

## 5\. Toggle Dark Mode On or Off ![Dark Mode Option Highlighted in the Facebook App Settings](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Dark-Mode-Option-Highlighted-in-the-Facebook-App-Settings.jpg)

 Dark Mode reduces the strain on your eyes and allows you to focus more easily on content at night. It also reduces the battery consumption of your phone.

 To enable Dark Mode, go to **Settings & Privacy > Settings > Preferences > Dark Mode** . It provides you with three options:**On** ,**Off** , and**Use System Settings** . The**Use System Settings** option can detect the default mode of your system and matches the Facebook app’s mode accordingly.

## 6\. Toggle Continuous Contact Upload ![Upload Contacts Option Highlighted in the Facebook App Settings](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Upload-Contacts-Option-Highlighted-in-the-Facebook-App-Settings.jpg)

![Continuous Contacts Upload Setting in the Facebook App](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Continuous-Contacts-Upload-Setting-in-the-Facebook-App.jpeg)

Close

 As you know, Facebook allows you to connect with your friends, colleagues, and family. And to find someone, you have to search for their name. However, some people don’t use their real names, and there might be instances where you might find tons of people with the same name.

 The Continuous Contact Upload feature allows you to connect with your contacts on Facebook by synchronizing your phone contacts with the app. It makes the whole connecting process more straightforward and effortless.

 You can turn this feature on or off by going to **Settings & Privacy > Settings > Permissions > Upload Contacts** . Once you turn it on, it takes you to the screen where you upload your contacts for the first time to find your friends. If you want to stop sharing this information with Facebook, toggle it off instead.

## 7\. Data Saver on Mobile Network ![Media-Settings-Highlighted-in-the-Facebook-App-1](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Media-Settings-Highlighted-in-the-Facebook-App-1.jpg)

Close

 As discussed above, Facebook has a massive amount of content, including images, videos, and text-based posts. It will eat up your mobile data if you use Facebook on your cellular network. The good news is that the Facebook app has a Data Saver feature that reduces video and image quality to help you conserve data.

 The feature claims to use 40% less data when you turn on the Data Saver mode. To enable it, go to **Settings & Privacy > Settings > Preferences > Media** . Here you’ll find the Data Saver option, among other useful media-related preferences.

## 8\. Open Links Externally ![Media-Settings-Highlighted-in-the-Facebook-App-2](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Media-Settings-Highlighted-in-the-Facebook-App-2.jpg)

![Links Open Externally Setting Highlighted in the Facebook App](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Links-Open-Externally-Setting-Highlighted-in-the-Facebook-App.jpg)

Close

 Facebook has an in-app browser that allows you to open external links within the app. However, you might prefer to load links in your default browser so that you can easily bookmark pages and enter login details where required. Facebook allows you to do so through its app settings.

 To enable this feature, go to **Settings & Privacy > Settings > Preferences > Media** . Scroll to the bottom and check the**Links Open Externally** option. Now every time you open a link, it will redirect you to your default phone browser.

## 9\. View Your Wi-Fi and Cellular Performance ![WiFi and Cellular Performance Option Highlighted in the Facebook App](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/WiFi-and-Cellular-Performance-Option-Highlighted-in-the-Facebook-App.jpg)

 If you are on a cellular network, you can test its speed and check the signal strength in your area. It also lets you test the speed of your Wi-Fi connection and find the available public Wi-Fi networks on the map.

 Furthermore, you can manage the network-related notifications and location settings by tapping on the**cog icon** in the top-right corner.

## 10\. Adjust Your Facebook Reels Settings ![Reels Option Highlighted in the Facebook App Settings](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Reels-Option-Highlighted-in-the-Facebook-App-Settings.jpg)
