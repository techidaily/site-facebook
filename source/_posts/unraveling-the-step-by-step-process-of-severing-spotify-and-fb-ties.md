## Unraveling the Step-By-Step Process of Severing Spotify and FB Ties

 Spotify allows you to connect with Facebook in order to be more social about your listening activity and share your favorite tracks and lyrics with your Facebook friends.

 However, perhaps you want to unlink your Facebook account from Spotify. In this case, you'll want to set aside ten minutes or so, as unlinking your Facebook account from Spotify is not as simple as it sounds.

## What You Should Do Before Unlinking Your Spotify Account From Facebook

 You could decide to unlink Facebook from your Spotify account for any number of reasons. Perhaps you're not interested in Spotify's social features and don't wish to be found by others this way. Perhaps you no longer use Facebook and want to make sure you can still access your Spotify account without it. Perhaps you just prefer not to chain platforms together this way.

 Spotify could definitely make it easier for you to unlink your Facebook account. Given how many ways to keep your Spotify account secure there are, it'd be easier to unlink from an app.

Here's what you should do to unlink Facebook from Spotify.

 Log in to Spotify via your Facebook account, and then reset your password via [the Spotify page](https://www.spotify.com/is-en/account/change-password/) . Make sure to [create a strong password that you definitely remember](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/6-tips-for-creating-an-unbreakable-password-that-you-can-remember/) , as you'll need it to log into Spotify later. Feel free to ignore this step if you definitely know your password.

## How to Disconnect Your Spotify Account From Facebook

 Now, if you go to Spotify across the mobile app, web app, and desktop app, you'll notice that it doesn't mention anywhere about unlinking Facebook from your account. You can affect Facebook's permissions in terms of the data it receives from your Spotify account, but nothing about unlinking.

 So instead, you have to unlink Spotify directly from Facebook, and you can do it on the web app and the Facebook app.

### How to Disconnect Your Spotify Account From Facebook (Desktop)

###

1. Go to [Facebook](http://facebook.com) and make sure you're logged in.
2. Click your profile icon and click**Settings & privacy** , then**Settings** .
3. On the**Settings** page, click the**Apps & websites** tab from the sidebar.
4. Next to Spotify, click**Remove** .

### How to Disconnect Your Spotify Account From Facebook (Mobile)

 You can also manage the apps and websites connected to your Facebook. Here's how:

1. Open the Facebook app and ensure you are logged in.
2. Tap**Menu** and then scroll down to the**Settings & Privacy** drop-down. Tap it and then tap**Settings** .
3. Scroll down to the**Permissions** section and tap**Apps and websites** .
4. On the**Apps and websites** page, tap**Spotify** \>**Remove** .

Close

 Whichever platform you do this on, you should have successfully unlinked Facebook from your Spotify account and can now log in without it.

## Enjoy Spotify Without Facebook

 Some people may enjoy having their Spotify account connected with Facebook, but you likely didn't for any number of reasons. Now you can continue to use your Spotify account without that worrying about Facebook. If you ever change your mind, you can always reconnect to a Facebook account in the future.

 For now, focus on finding the best playlists around and enjoying your favorite tracks on Spotify.
