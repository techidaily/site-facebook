## Unveiling the Veil of Virtual Vaults: Downloading FB Hidden Videos

 Want to download a public video off Facebook? There are dozens of tools. You can even download them straight from Facebook without any third-party tools.

 But how do you download a private Facebook video? Because they are private, public Facebook video downloaders will not work. That's not to say it isn't possible—you only need to go through a few steps to download one.

 If you want to know how to download private Facebook videos, keep reading. We'll start with a manual workaround, then introduce you to some of the best tools to easily download private videos from Facebook.

## How to Download Private Facebook Videos Manually

 If you don't want to rely on third-party tools, you can download private Facebook videos directly using your browser's developer tool. It's straightforward and doesn't require a development background. The process is pretty much the same on most browsers. But try using Chrome for a better result.

 The process involves picking the media request URL from the Network tab and going to the video URL to load a downloadable video.

 To manually download a private Facebook video, once you load the video you want to download:

1. Right-click anywhere outside the video frame and click**Inspect** . Or press**F12** on your keyboard to open the Inspect tab.

2. Go to the**Network** tab.
3. Click**Media** .
4. Then reload the video page. This populates the request table with some parameters.
5. Click the string that appears under the**Name** column.

6. Copy the**Request URL** under**Headers** and load it into a new browser tab. This loads the video in the new browser tab.

## Third-Party Video Downloaders You Can Use With Facebook

 If you'd rather use a web-based downloader, there are a few services on the that are worth checking out.

### 1. FBDownloader ![fbdownloader](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/fbdownloader.png)

### 3. PasteDownload ![pastedownload](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/pastedownload.png)

**Available on: Web**

 Realistically, all these apps do the same thing. You'll only need to get this far down the list if something unexpected happens. But it is always good to have more tools at your disposal, right?

 PasteDownload performs the same task. It offers yet another simple way to download private Facebook videos by copying and pasting the video's source code.

### 4. Getfvid ![getfvid](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/getfvid.png)

**Available on: Web**

 Getfvid provides two tools. There's one for downloading public Facebook videos and another for downloading private Facebook videos. The download process remains identical. Grab the code, paste it in, and enjoy the video offline again.

 But before you think of sharing a video you've downloaded, note and follow the points below.

## Download Private Facebook Videos Ethically

 If you use one of these tools to download private Facebook videos, please do so ethically. Remember, if a person has made a video private, it's probably for a good reason. It might contain personal data, sensitive information, or other compromising footage.

 You should not distribute another person's private material in a public forum without their permission. In the case of artists, musicians, and other creative professionals, doing so could even land you in trouble with the law.
