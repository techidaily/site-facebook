## What Can You Achieve with the Facebook Help System?

 No matter how long you've used Facebook, you've probably needed help once or twice. You could have needed help with setting up two-factor authentication, or recovering a hacked account, for instance. In some cases, you may have asked friends for help. At other times, you may have turned to Google instead.

 What's worse, you may not even get the help you seek when you need it. How frustrating!

 Thankfully, Facebook has a solution. In this article, you'll learn more about what Facebook Help Center is, how to access it, and what Help Center can help you with.

## What Is Facebook Help Center?

 As the name implies,[Facebook Help Center](https://www.facebook.com/help) is Facebook's dedicated help page that tries to answer your most pressing questions about using Facebook.

 Help Center has a simple and user-friendly interface that makes getting most of the help you need a breeze.

 It features a search box that allows you to search help articles by entering specific queries about the issues you're facing. For instance, you can search for [the new Facebook music-revenue sharing program](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-facebook-music-revenue-sharing-program/) . You can now sort through the results for the most relevant help article for your query.

 Alternatively, you can seek help by directly clicking on any of the available sections under the main page. You can also use the quick access menu on the left side pane (on desktop) to get help quickly.

 Another cool thing about Help Center is that you can access it in different languages if using a desktop. To select your preferred language, click on the language box next to your profile picture. Here's [how to change your Facebook profile picture](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-change-facebook-profile-picture/) .

 You can also access your Support Inbox and report a problem using the drop-down arrow next to the language box. Your Support Inbox is where you'll find pages you've reported as well as alerts about potentially sensitive content in your posts.

 From Help Center, you can directly link to Meta Business Help Center which provides information on how to troubleshoot ads, manage accounts, monetize content, and sell on Facebook and Instagram.

 Most importantly, you can easily access Facebook Help Center using your desktop or your smartphone whether you're at your desk or on the go.

 Accessing Facebook Help Center is easy and essentially the same process on desktop and on mobile. Here's how:

1. Open Facebook.
2. Click on your profile picture.
3. Select**Help and support** .
