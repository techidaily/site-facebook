## You Can Now Transfer Facebook Posts and Notes to Three Popular Services

 If you're leaving Facebook or you just want to make a backup of your Facebook data, you can now export your Facebook posts and notes to three popular services. These services include Google Docs, Blogger, and WordPress.com.

## Export Facebook Notes and Posts to Three Major Services

 As announced on [Facebook Newsroom](https://about.fb.com/news/2021/04/transfer-your-facebook-posts-and-notes-with-our-expanded-data-portability-tool/) , the social giant will allow users to transfer their posts and notes to three popular online services. You'll be able to export your posts and notes to Google Docs, Blogger, and WordPress.com.

In Facebook's own words:

> To give people more control and choice over their data, today weâ€™re introducing two new data portability types, Facebook posts and notes. People can now directly transfer their notes and posts to Google Docs, Blogger and WordPress.com.

 All these services are pretty popular. Google Docs is known for its excellent office features. Blogger is Google's own blogging platform, and WordPress.com helps people create WordPress-based blogs for free.

 Users of these services will appreciate this expansion of Facebook's data transfer tool.

## How Facebook's Posts and Notes Transfer Tool Works

 Facebook has integrated the option to transfer content to these services in its existing data transfer tool. When you access this tool and begin to transfer your data, you'll be asked to re-enter your password to confirm your identity.

 Also, Facebook will encrypt your data while it's being transferred to ensure the data remains secure.

## How to Transfer Facebook Posts and Notes to Various Services

 As a user, you just need to make a few clicks on Facebook's site to get your data transferred to your chosen service.

 If you haven't used the data transfer tool before, the following should help you out:

1. Open the [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/) site, click the down-arrow icon at the top-right corner, select**Settings & Privacy** , and then select**Settings** .
2. Click**Your Facebook Information** on the left.
3. Select**Transfer a Copy of Your Information** on the right.
4. Choose either**Posts** or**Notes** to transfer.
5. From the**Choose Destination** dropdown menu, select your preferred target service.
6. Click**Next** to continue.

 Follow the on-screen instructions to initiate the data transfer process. This shouldn't take too long as Facebook uses a server-to-server transfer system.
